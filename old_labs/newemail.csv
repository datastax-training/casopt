jeff_dasovich|Notes inbox|to my CA friends|My advice to President W or to the '04 GOP nominee in the unfortunate case that it's not W running for re-election:  Never, ever, ever again step foot in the state of California during the next four years including your race for re-election. The only exception would be to attend Ronald Reagan's funeral.  It's a waste of time.  As president, make regular trips to Florida, Illinois, Michigan, PA, Wisconsin and any other state that doesn't cost you $12 million and hours of wasted time in the air to get there, only to reject you by a solid 13 percentage points. If a candidate like you can't win in CA, then a total GOP abandonment of the state should be imposed for the next millennium. I don't care how many electoral votes they may have. You're young, attractive (which is usually all it takes in CA), you spent lots time and money, had an opponent who spent nothing, sold your political soul by disavowing 189 and 209 in order to reach out to minorities and were right on all the issues for the techies like tort reform, taxes and rolling back regulations.  How can a candidate try to influence the deep thinkers who call CA home when you're up against the sound advice they receive from Cher, Babs, the Baldwin Brothers, the DreamWorks team, Whoopie and Rosie. It's obvious that Californians would rather send to Washington, someone who can inspire a hit TV program like the "West Wing", two liberal senators (one of whom is the shrillest, most hypocritical apologist in political history) and a vast majority of liberals to the  U.S. House while rejecting decent people like Jim Rogan, Steve Kynendall and Brian Bilbray.  Once in office, you should work with the Republican congress to reward these Californians by ensuring that they receive no highway money, no research money and most of all, no disaster relief money. The last one should really hurt since they're due for another big one, or a big fire, or a big mud slide, or a big Pacific storm.  Of course, this advice is coming from someone who now calls a state home that has decided to send to the United States Senate, one of the most truthful, honest, humble, dedicated and caring individuals ever to unselfishly enter public life. I mean elected public life, because she's already been working on the issues that really matter to families for over 30 years.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

shackleton-s|Notes inbox| Re: Tech contact for ITG Europe Platform installation - ENA and ECT Investments,	 Inc.|Further to my voicemail message yesterday I wanted to advise the outcome of  our latest discussions with John Greene and Gary Hickerson with respect to  the corporate structure for equities trading by London based employees.   The recommendation is that an agent (which will be a UK incorporated entity)  will incur the costs of those employees based in London. The UK agent will  arrange equities transactions in the name of ENA (ie. ENA will be the  principal to the trade) in accordance with a services agreement. The services  agreement will be supplemented by detailed daily instructions issued by ENA  employees based in Houston which will set out strict limits under which the  UK agent can arrange such equity transactions. Detailed procedures will be  drafted which if properly observed should prevent the establishment of a tax  presence for ENA in the UK (a deemed UK tax presence through the UK agent).  These procedures are being developed in conjunction with the relevant  commercial parties (John Greene, Gary Hickerson etc) to ensure that they are  both practical and effective and are not merely a "rubber-stamping" exercise  which would not afford adequate protection against the creation of a UK tax  presence for ENA.  Whether EEFT will be the agent or a newly incorporated UK entity is subject  to some further due diligence on the UK regulatory side. The strong  preference is not to use EEFT if possible.  Thus with regard to the Instinet trading system, the party which will execute  the trades as principal via Instinet will be ENA. The services performed by  the agent in arranging the transactions for ENA via Instinet, will need to be  governed by the same services agreement and procedures outlined above in  respect of offline trades.   I have not had the opportunity to discuss the above proposal with our  colleagues in ENA tax but they are familiar with the alternative scenarios  which were under consideration. If further discussion of this issue is needed  urgently I can be contacted for the rest of the week at the Swissotel,  Istanbul, Turkey (8 hours ahead of Houston time) - telephone # 90 212 259 01  01; fax # 90 212 326 11 22 or alternatively try mobile # (44) 77 88 437 195.  I will also be picking up voicemail on 44 207 783 5326.  Regards Janine    To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Janine Juggins/LON/ECT@ECT, Jordan Mintz/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Tech contact for ITG Europe Platform installation - ENA and ECT  Investments, Inc.    As just described in my earlier E-mail on this matter, this raises several  concerns and is not a good idea.  It would be preferable to have one of our  foreign affiliates contract for the service.  Separately, it appears that a  form of trading for ENA is contemplated in London which, as we have  discussed, raises serious tax nexus concerns for us.  Consequently, I have  cc'd Janine Juggins on this E-mail so that she is aware of matters and can  explore to see what is actually contemplated.  Janine, I suspect that we need  to clarify on whose behalf people work while in London (EEL?).  I will be in  Canada this week and will try to speak with you while away but,  alternatively, you can speak with Janine directly and/or contact me at the  Hotel Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia.

If not, please consider  the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being  in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London  install so the two sites are in synch.

Doug is really responsible for gas as  an adjunct to their local efforts, as well as a change to indicate, also as  we discussed, that these responsibilites are flexible, in response to  changing commercial priorities, as well as the need to support the other  Wholesale businesses.   mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 10/04/2001  07:45 ---------------------------   Richard Lewis 09/04/2001 19:17 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Eric Shaw/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Richard  Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark  Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Enron Europe Governtal & Regulatory Affairs Organization  Announcement    Paul Dawson covers the coal group as well (any others, Mark?) .

Mark - please let me know once we have spoken to the five senior managers in your group as we do not want to  send this out until either you, Michael or I have spoken to them about this structure.   Draft  After nearly five years in London, Mark Schroeder will be returning to the US  on April 11th to join the North American Coal Business with responsibility  for origination in the utility sector.  Under Mark,s leadership, his team has  made significant contributions towards Enron Europe,s &first mover8 advantage  and its status as the leading new entrant in the liberalizing pan)European  energy markets.  We wish him well in his new commercial role.   With Mark,s departure, the day-to-day management of the Government &  Regulatory Affairs Department in Europe will rest with Peter Styles, Paul  Dawson, Paul Hennemeyer, and Doug Wood.  Nick O,Day will continue in his  current leadership capacity in Japan.  Each of these five individuals and  their groups will now jointly report to the business heads and to Rick  Shapiro, in the Government Affairs team in Houston. Rick Shapiro will  continue to manage Government Affairs for the Americas.  While the team  members responsibilities will vary from time-to-time in response to shifting  commercial priorities, as well as the need to support other Enron Wholesale  Services' business units from time-to-time, the general areas of  responsibility will be as follows:  Peter Styles, based in Brussels, will continue to have responsibilty for our  EU and Netherlands advocacy.   Paul Hennemeyer will lead efforts in the  German speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) as well as France  and Belgium.  Peter and Paul will report to Eric Shaw.  While secunded to the  commercial team in France, Philip Davies will address Nordic market issues on  an ad hoc basis and also report to Paul on these issues.    Paul Dawson will lead our UK, Spain and Italian power regulatory efforts as  well as the gas regulatory work in the UK.  Doug Wood will support the  Continental Gas team and the Central and Southeastern Europe Origination  efforts, while also addressing the UK Climate Change Levy.  Doug's role in  gas will continue to be to supplement, and not to supplant, the efforts of  each of the team members' geographic responsibilities noted on the  organisation chart.  Paul and Doug will report to Richard Lewis locally.  Nick O,Day will also continue to report to Joe Hirl in Japan.    Other regulatory support provided by Mark Schroder will be addressed in  another organizational announcement that will be sent out from Governmental Affairs in Houston.  Attached is the revised  organization chart that now reflects the Governmental & Regulatory Affairs  organization in Enron Europe.

Kaiser Aluminum closed its smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to resell contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spokesman Review, "Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales." Other aluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agreed, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA that negates a "take-or-pay" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the federal power whether used or not. BPA said, "Under the agreement signed today, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are not going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference," Clearing Up reported. As a concession for the elimination of the "take-or-pay" clause, Kaiser will receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Kaiser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power "to pay down long-term debt, rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuses," rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off, the BPA, and building generation, AP reported. More... <https://www2.enronforum.com/content?content_id=115987203>   <https://ib.intellibridge.com/content?content_id=80296803>   United States-Energy:  CA Power Authority Names CEO (IB) The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority named Laura Doll its new chief executive officer on 5 October. Texan Doll "had previously worked for several communications and consulting firms," and will be receiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will retain his post. Freeman said he will "handle fewer administrative duties," and will "be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups such as the Legislature and consumer groups," The Chronicle reported. According to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, businesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the power authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can issue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through financing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said that businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of green power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The state's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's planned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Keeley. Keeley said "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law," the Register reported. More... <https://www2.enronforum.com/content?content_id=115979903>  United States-Energy:  FERC Refunds Ordered (IB) On 5 October, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered four power marketers to provide refunds for July sales that exceeded a federally mandated price limit. Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Reliant Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC order, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the volatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charging in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the month in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all were rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but did not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Although FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent System Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, The Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the rejection of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mirant and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were "untimely and...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transactions," according to the document. Reliant's filing was "not consistent with the requirements of the June 19 Order," and Willams "did not provide any cost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the commission's pricing methodology," the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spokesman told Reuters that "his company was ordered to refund $33,800," while a Williams spokesman told the LA Times "$30,000 worth of electricity sales are subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July."

Enron's Tim Beldon wrote me that he would consider it.  The PX's Gene Waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to the WSJ.  I talked with Dynegy's Lynn Lednicky this morning and he suggested that the PX has aggregated data for several days, and that releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members would give the WSJ a better window into the issues.  That is, simply releasing your bid data will not tell the WSJ anything of value.  I know that Rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are polled our at her choice, not ours.  It must be necessary to assure there is no possibility of bias.  I am wondering if the PX would be willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which the WSJ selects, and then give us the opportunity to release our individual data for the same days?   I am also wondering if we shouldn't have an off-the-record teleconference call with the WSJ whereby both sides can get a better understanding of what the WSJ wants, and how we can best provide it. Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week, say Wednesday or Thursday?  gba    *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

weldon-c|Stagecoach| Stagecoach gas questions|Hi guys,  I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the  answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the  rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if  you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this  under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you  guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso  and ask questions they've already answered.   1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver  this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?  2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If  interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm  storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?      3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP "cost of  carry" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are  there any "IN STORAGE"  transfer costs?   4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?  5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach  project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES  inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?  6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a  basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be  firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?    7.  If possible, can EES "pick" an alternate delivery point as our primary  point of delivery for this project?    I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set  aside - will this work for you Mark?

symes-k|Ees| Re: Daily EES Positions through 4/19|Hey Kate,  For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside  Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in  your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be  increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?  Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday  (which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality,  it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside  and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where  it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of  0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were  at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Tony,  I assume Lou briefed you on the situation.  I think the most recent liquids  sample had pcbs in excess of 50 ppm.  That is well in excess of the  contractual limit that I recall to be 1 ppm.  Our research a few months ago  was about options to force the interconnect back open above 250 mm/d if the  samples came back clean.  Now, the issue is, given dirty samples, what can we  do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut.  We need to complete our  research/thinking immediately and have a spectrum of options ready to  discuss.  Seriously, I am reviewing with Lou the option of a preemptive shut  down of the interconnect, but that looks like an unwise strategy so far.  ALL  ideas are worth considering.  Frank, Steve, and Maria, anything in your  memory banks on TW or FERC jurisprudence that would prevent a Hinshaw from  refusing to schedule transport volumes through a point even if the Hinshaw  seemed to have clear contractual rights to refuse to schedule volumes based  on gas quality/contamination concerns?  I don't think TW's tariff has a  specific PCB spec.   DF      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for "retirement."  The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to "integrated resource planning."  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.  We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available.  -----Original Message----- From: Andy Brown [mailto:abb@eslawfirm.com] Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 10:36 AM To: Steven Kelly; doug kerner; Jan Smutny-Jones Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting Importance: High   FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress, with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.  CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to "integrated resource planning" with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission, etc.  CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re economic projects.  CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCE's.  CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation. PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement.   -- Andrew Brown Sacramento, CA andybrwn@earthlink.net      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

donohoe-t|Drafts| RE: Resumes|Any one on the desk can carry any position they want.  The only area we are not to trade is the california market.  That VAR is left for those traders.  We do specialize in our own area and for different time periods.  We each trade all products(physical and financial) for our respective time periods.  Our specialties are as follows:  Tom Donohoe - current and prompt month ANR SE and M2, NGPL STX/LA/TXOK/GCML, TRKL STX/ELA/WLA/Mainline, Reliant all zones and MRT - not much happens here.  Kevin Ruscitti - All the same areas plus financial Prompt Mich and Consumers.  Andy Lewis - ANR SW, Panhandle Field, OGT, NGPL Amarillo Leg, NNG  Jason Williams - Same as Andy but for Current and Prompt  Jim Simpson - Current and prompt Chicago  Martin Cuilla - Canadian areas that feed into Chicago, Mich and Wisconsin.  Hunter Shively - VP over all Central Trading.  I believe that all the locations are correct.  As you can see we have the bases covered.  The important thing is that we are not limited to trade only our areas.  Any of us can trade any location in the US except California.  The long term traders are set up by area.  Brynat Fryhart covers all the Oklahoma/Arkansas midcontinet area.  He has a great relashionship with these folks.  Sylvia Polan and Russel Murrel covers Michigan.  Patrice Thurston covers Chicago.  Linda Roberts covers the supply for Bryants area.  She also has excellent contacts.  Laura Luce is the VP over all the marketers.  We then have 10 people scheduling all the gas. We need so many because of the amount of gas transacted.  We then have back office personnel that run our books.  The way the desk works is that we as traders make the market for anyone that wants to trade our specific areas. -----Original Message----- From: Audrey Cullen Davis [mailto:ACullen@FirstCallAssociates.com] Sent: Saturday, November 17, 2001 10:38 AM To: Donohoe, Tom Subject: RE: Resumes   Hi Tom,  I will need an idea of long term traders as well.

kenneth_lay|'sent|Re: Milken Institute Conference Sponsorship|Mr. Straszheim -  Mr. Lay did receive your e-mail - per your telephone call to us last evening.  Rosalee      Donald Straszheim <dstraszheim@milken-inst.org> on 02/01/2000 05:57:07 PM To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: John Quintanar <jquintanar@milken-inst.org>, Patricia Contreras  <PContreras@milken-inst.org>  Subject: Milken Institute Conference Sponsorship    Ken,  I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project. It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement, participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project unfolds.  Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10, 2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.  First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some representation from Enron in the audience.  Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier. This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on your organization for support.  We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.  I hope we can count on you.  Regards,  Donald H. Straszheim President Milken Institute 1250 Fourth Street, Second Floor Santa Monica, CA  90401 Tel:    310.998.2620 Fax:   310.998.2641 E-ml:  dstraszheim@milken-inst.org    <<GC 2000 Update 1_31_00.pdf>>  <<Sponsorship Tiers GC 2000pdf1.pdf.pdf>>    > Don't miss the Milken Institute's annual Global Conference, March 8-10, > 2000, in Los Angeles.

From:  V Charles Weldon                           08/28/2000 10:54 AM 	  To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, John  Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Shiring/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim Schwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Chris Gaskill/Corp/Enron@Enron, Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rogers  Herndon/HOU/ECT@ect, Fletcher J Sturm/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin M  Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Floating LNG Terminal  Folks,  As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning  portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no  such capability currently exists. According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel, http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm  Please let me know if any further research is needed.

jeffrey_a_shankman|Sent|Wells Fargo visit to Houston|Get with George Z. and get this on the calendar.  Thanks.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 12/18/2000  10:32 AM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  George Zivic                           12/18/2000 10:24 AM 	  To: Jeff Kinneman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT (bcc: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT) Subject: Wells Fargo visit to Houston  Jeff K.,  Just a follow up to our prior conversations.  Representatives from Wells Fargo will be visiting Enron on Tuesday, January  9, 2001.  As initially discussed, Wells is looking to learn more about Enron's overall  risk management/trading capabilities and to explore potential areas of  co-operation -- "areas where the two organisations may benefit from working  together". Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that  Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that, with a mandate to grow  their capital market reach, Wells will be looking to us as a potential  strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense  corporate client base.  Based on my relationship with them, they have expressed special interest in  EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they  have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for  various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some  sort of shared capabilities with our group -- I think that our focus on  solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition  to this, their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore  our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio.  Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring  various types of working relationships with us, I would suggest that we have  a senior presence at this meeting.  This being said, they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the  Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff  Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which  would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested  (Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative  capabilities). Also, our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in  participating during these discussions.   It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from  Wells Fargo: Treasurer Chief Credit Officer Sr. VP, & Head of Product Development, Capital Markets Head of Derivative Sales  My hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to  accomplish this, I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in  which to present -- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our  capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.

shapiro-r|All documents| Today's Senate Hearing|The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing  today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation  and other related energy issues.  The "star witness" was Gov. Davis.  Others  were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps,  Sens. Murkowski, Murray and Cantwell, Washington State's attorney general,  Oregon's PUC chairman, and the five FERC commissioners.  Once Davis left  after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions, most of the  press and audience left.  Enron was mentioned several times as follows:   1. Sen. Thompson, the Ranking Republican, mentioned Lockyer's "Spike"  comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make  new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty, there  is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials.   Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not.  (Thompson gave him a  second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific  reference again to "Spike," asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of  the AG's Spike comments.)  The first time Davis said that the people he  represents are mad, they want him to fight back, this is rough business, the  industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment, things occassionally  get out of hand, and we are not going to take it.  On the second instance, he  said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not  being diminished.   2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his  handling of the situation, using quotes from California newspapers to make  the case that Davis was slow to act.  He also argued that the state had done  a bad job as a power purchaser, contrasting the state's recent 8-year  contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with  Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50.  The  Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but  is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more.  Davis  said they should make refunds, too.   3. While not saying Enron by name, Gov. Davis did make a comment about  companies with "trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange  with meteorologists and very talented people" who might have the ability to  find loopholes in the new order.  He said this in answer to a question about  what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued, and he said "watch  out for manipulation" by those subject to the order.   4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared  to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small  percentage of the market in her state, with lots of document requests and  other investigative action, while not doing the same to others.  During that  exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had  over $1 billion in sales to Washington State.  Enron was not on the list of  companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands.   She said she would be expanding her inquiry, though.  Highlights and Analysis   1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing, the mantra from the  Western Democrats was: we want our money back.  Chairman Lieberman and others  pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other  Western states, particularly Oregon and Washington.  Chairman Hebert said  that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all  issues, including refunds in California and outside California.  He said that  the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on  itself, including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act.   Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's  activities in implementing the new order, particularly as it relates to  refunds.  While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to  pending cases, he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day  delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds.   2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and  enforcement tools available to the commission, including the ability to order  short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business,  treble damages, and other administrative penalties.  There was also  discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's  market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC, FCC and  FTC than it has in the past.   3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's  latest order is a step in the right direction.  None of them called for  legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith.   Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated  price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that  the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at  yesterday's hearing.  Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates  are better, but he said the new order is "some price relief" and that it  corrected the mistakes in the April order.   4. There was some discussion of natural gas again.  Davis said that FERC  should now turn its attention to natural gas.  He said that El Paso  controlled too much of the capacity until recently.  He called on FERC to  enforce laws against price manipulation.  (Note: we have had several back  channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso  and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.)   5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order.   Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon.   Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not  more time and that order should apply until California has enough new  generation in place.  Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman  later in the hearing, saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on  new supplies, however he and the others basically said they would revisit the  issue if events warrant.   6. Several times, Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support  deregulation, but that the effort to get more states to do so will never  happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public  confidence restored.   7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood,  saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to  California, including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of  transportation to California.  He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that  FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush  appointees were on the commission.   8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the  FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices.  She said not to her  knowledge even though she has asked them to do so.  We can expect a  Lieberman, et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward, I  suspect.   9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature  of his normal thoughtful tone, it is clear that he and others see this as a  major issue for them to ride.  He commended FERC at the end of the hearing  for doing their best, but pledged he would stay involved, closing the session  with a smile and the words "see you soon."  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

griffith-j|Discussion threads| Re: Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation|Sandy,  As a result of recent contract re-negotiations, the proposed Cabot Oil & Gas  Marketing Corporation deals in Terrebonne Parish has changed significantly.   First, our reserve study has been completed and we have determined that the  Turtle Bayou Field production is expected to last only 18 months.  Second,  Cabot has balked at our tiered pricing proposal, so 100% of the production  will be index priced.  Third, Cabot will only commit its working interest  share of production, not its partners' share.  Fourth, one of the 4 wells  (Castex #1) has been removed from the contract.  Finally, Cabot has indicated  it will not accept a price less than index flat.  A revised expectation of volumes for the two Cabot deals is attached.

shackleton-s|All documents| Trades Terminated or in Dispute|Pursuant to our conversation, the different scenarios for trades in dispute  are (and may not be limited to) the following:  Trade agreed Trade not booked    No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed on T/D  No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed after T/D  No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Trade killed  Confirm sent  Trade booked Trade disputed     No Confirm sent Trade booked  Trade disputed     Confirm sent  Examples:  Scenario 1: the CP calls back one hour after the trade was agreed and states  they now do not agree with the trade. Essentially, it could be disputed  wether or not we had a trade, even though our tapes support our position. No  impact on booking or Confirmation Desk.  Scenarios 2 and 3 occur essentially the same as Scenario 1 with the exception  that the trade is booked. Scenario 2 and 3 a different based on the pricing  implication of a trade booked overnight. In both these scenarios, we should  consider issuing a Termination Agreement which gives some reference to the  details of the agreed transaction.  Scenario 4 is the most straight-forward. An agreed trade, booked and  Confirmed, we issue a Termination Agreement.  Scenarios 5 and 6 are different from Scenarios 2 and 3 in that we have booked  a trade based on our understanding, but OUR understanding of the terms was  incorrect. The two scenarios are different in that in 5 a Confirmation is not  sent. In 5, we should consider issuing a side letter stating that a trade was  booked in error and no such trade exists. In 6 we should consider issuing a  side letter stating the trade was booked AND the Confirmation was sent in  error - and ask that they return the Confirmation.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

dutch_quigley|Sent Items| |06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL E.10 (Copyright 2001)  THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things.  Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute.  And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.  We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.  But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised.  Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't.  AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need.  I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used.  We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.  Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it!  Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch!  I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money.  We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Greg Johnston 	03/12/2001 02:18 PM 		 		 To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Re: Option Language  Mark, you are right on the second point.  I think we are probably okay  there.  I understand from our option traders that they intend to set the  products themselves up on EOL to address the different calculations in the  products themselves rather than coming up with different long descriptions  for each.  Does that make any sense or should we be setting up separate long  descriptions for each of the types of options they want to offer?   From: Mark Taylor on 03/12/2001 01:28 PM CST To: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Option Language    Greg:  It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on  the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical  Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and  calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.  On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already  covers the treatment of holidays:    ...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or  for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the  preceding business day)...  which makes the deleted language redundant.    	Greg Johnston 	03/12/2001 11:30 AM 		 		 To: Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Re: Option Language  Melba, I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they  should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount  to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the  option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options  (puts, calls, collars, etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the  Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally  put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is "the greater  of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website", such that the  actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth  in each specific product.  Therefore, I would suggest we change it back to  the original wording.  On the second change, I know that the wording that was removed is important  to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will  be the case if we make the suggested change), I am not sure as to what the  default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for  holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed,  otherwise the wording removed needs to be put back in.  I am also not clear  on why we would remove the wording in the first place and create any  uncertainty as to holiday pricing.  Thanks Greg   To: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT  Subject: Option Language  Greg,  Attached please find the language for the Option products.

holden_salisbury|Inbox|NEVP transmission| Please be aware that the last leg of transmission listed on tag #28010 is a dummy leg of transmission that needs to be placed on the tag in order to reflect Valley Electrics Load at Mead 230.  We use this dummy leg of transmission because Valley Electric does not have a PSE acronym in the OATI tagging system.  We have been creating tags such as this since the OATI tagging system has been in use and have not or should not be getting charged for using NEVP trani.  Please refer to the following tag numbers as examples:  22655, 22654, 26279, 26387.  Please note that each of these tags was approved by NEVP the control area and NEVP the transmission provider and therefore has been implemented.   It was our understanding that this was a practice agreed upon by NEVP and Enron in order to reflect Valley Electrics load at Mead.   My contact at Nevp is Jannella Battles.   Please, keep me in the loop as to what the result of this issue will be.

From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.  Questions that need to be answered,  	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier? 	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?  	  The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.

shapiro-r|All documents| RE: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3) Directive|COMMENTS BELOW TO PAUL'S QUESTIONS.    From: Paul Hennemeyer/Enron@EUEnronXGate on 07/03/2001 09:51 AM GDT To: Brendan Devlin/EU/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Peter  Styles/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Dawson/Enron@EUEnronXGate, Doug  Wood/Enron@EUEnronXGate cc: Nailia Dindarova/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: RE: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3)  Directive  Devlin  Thanks for the note. Very useful. A few questions for clarification:  1. Can the Directive do nothing about legal unbundling? As I understand it  this involves no change in ownership but just a requirement that the owners of Company X spin off their network operations into a  different company - which they would still own.  NO; ANY CHANGE IN THE LEGAL STRUCTURE WOULD BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF SUCH A  DIRECTIVE.  EVEN IF ULTIMATE OWNERSHIP REMAINS UNCHANGED, FORCING A  STRUCTURAL CHANGE WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.  MIND YOU, IT WAS UNTIL RECENTLY  THOUGHT THAT THE COMMISSION COULD NOT REQUIRE DIVESTMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF A  MERGER REVIEW.  2. It seems that your statement that "only States can be addressed" opens up  the possibility that States could, following an  86-based Directive, undertake a range of actions - including forcing a more level playing field by  requiring more unbundling and regulated TPA. Is this correct?  YES  3.What specific actions might be undertaken by the Commission as part of  86-based Directive?   Thanks, Paul        -----Original Message----- From:  Devlin, Brendan   Sent: 02 July 2001 17:55 To: Shapiro, Richard; Styles, Peter; Hennemeyer, Paul; Dawson, Paul; Wood,  Doug Cc: Dindarova, Nailia Subject: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3) Directive  This e-mail is for background information so that we can have a clear view on  the prospects and content of  an eventual Art 86(3) Directive.    The current European Commission's Directive is based on Art. 95 of the  Amsterdam Treaty; this is an harmonisation Directive, which means that it can  address any issue likely to impede cross-border flows of goods and services,  and can have positive effects (such as requirements to set up a regulator).   An Art 86(3) Directive, on the other hand, can only address concerns within  the context of Art 86: Art 86 stipulates that member States of the EU shall  not favour government owned entities or other entities, to whom public  service obligations (PSO) have been assigned, unless such favour is necesary  for that entity to carry out it's P.S.O..  Art 86(3) Directives are  prohibitive and preventative, rather than prescriptive.  In short, Art. 86 means that the competition rules apply to EdF, and if the  member state won't enforce a level field, the Commission will.  In procedural terms, Art. 86(3) Directives do not have to be passed by the  Council (member states) nor by the Parliament, though in practice the  Commission does not act unilaterally and seeks tacit cover. Thus, in the  Telecomms sector, when the member States found it too hard politically to  liberalise, they engineered an impasse in Council and invited sotto voce the  Commission to force them to do it. In effect, the Stockholm Council's  Conclusions are a similar coded request (the reference to competition rules  would include Art. 86). Once before the College of the Commission, an Art  86(3) directive has to be agreed by simple a majority vote of all  Commissioners (even if they are absent, so you need 11 positive votes). It  cannot be blocked by a single Commissioner. Even if France/Germany combine,  there would be 16 positive votes and four against.  What can an Art 86(3) Directive do?  -- Enforce accounts and management unbundling (not legal unbundling as that  entails change of ownership). -- Abolish any exclusive rights that have an anti-competitive effect (such as  exclusive use of infrastructure, rights to import/export, interconnector  rights?). -- Broadly speaking, force liberalisation in a utilities sector.  What an Art 86(3) Directive cannot do?  -- Force any legal person to do anything (companies, individuals etc). Only  States can be addressed. -- Address positive regulatory issues (set tariffs, create regulators,  capacity upgrades, etc).  In Summary: An Art 86(3) directive would be different from the directive  already on the table; it would be more focussed and less general and would  provide remedies for identified anti-competitive activities.    Action:  We should be in a position to place before the Commission an array  of anti-competitive actions that can be remedied by an Art. 86(3) Directive,  especially with regard to exclusive rights..

Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at  Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker  (713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one  in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new  agreement when he had time.

mary_hain|All documents|SoCal Edison files cease and desist re PX at FERC|Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to  cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts  until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has  proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts  back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend  its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks  the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.  I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of  the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission  ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and  (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed  in the auction.    Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about  it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its  retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?  What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero?      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

First, he is patently threatening the customer and Enron that if the self-gen units are parallel or regularly run as peak shavers ( "IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving") standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the contract.  Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us.  It is imperative that we have our rights straight:  	First, that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel; 	Second, that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the ICC; and 	Third, that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its self-gen units as peak shavers.  	Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer that the units are truly isolated. The customer will need to run its units to peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously. 	The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the Commission now.  We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IP's tariffs in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customer's (and hence Enron's as agent) rights under the tariffs.                    <Embedded StdOleLink>  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

I have hilighted the language that provides that the fixed price for the second transaction will be the midpoint of the bid and offer prices for physical power.  Simply delete the hilighted language if the traders decide to base the fixed price on the midpoint of the financial swap instead.

schoolcraft-d|Junk| Operator Qualification|The Operator Qualification (OQ) Rule, 49 CFR 192.801 requires that all pipelines develop a qualification program to evaluate individual's ability to perform covered tasks.  Each gas controller must complete the qualification program no later than June 1, 2002.  Each task must be completed in the presence of a trained Verifier in order to be qualified for that covered task.  The successful completion of a task must be documented and sent to the Training Group.  An individual may ask to be verified on a task as many times as necessary to successfully complete the task and receive a "Qualified" status.  At the November gas control staff meeting each gas controller was given a copy of the Skills Qualification Manual (SQM) and the Training and Verification Guide (TV Guide) to review.  I will be receiving the official personalized SQM this week and verification can begin at any time after that.  Steve January will assign you to one of the verifiers listed below:  Jerry Graves Dale Ratliff Darrell Schoolcraft Gary Spraggins   Verification and qualification will take place on days and at the control board.  Your team members will be responsible for operating your position and answering the phone during this process.  It is very important to keep interruptions at minimum.  You can verify on all or any part of the SQM when you feel you are ready.   We are required by law to document that you can perform the task in the SQM. Remember this is your job, you do this everyday, and you do it very well.

ring-r|PersonalFolder| Third Quarter Earnings Results| Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.  We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.  Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.  Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.  Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.   Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.  Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.  Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.  In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include: ·	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ·	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ·	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.    With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget.  The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that.  What do you think?

TJ and Claudette--Please forward to your groups.  Thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Rodriquez, Andy  Sent: Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:46 PM  Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.   General Observations   The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions.    FERC Deliverables  A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.    The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.  The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.  The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.    One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:   ·         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?   ·         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are allowed)?    ·         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?   ·         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?   ·         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?   ·         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?   ·         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?   ·         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?   Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financial hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.  Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.   NERC and GISB   A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.  Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.  Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.  There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.  The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.  Let me know if you have any questions.

shackleton-s|Policy| Enron Announcement|Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers  Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:  National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).    The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total  car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing  provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value  proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first  choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract  reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and  low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National,  where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or  Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate  selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or  Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for  any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.  For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000  per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.  ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following  contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded  on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)  To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's  preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in  National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club  membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the  transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid  return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron  travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron  American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on  the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

keavey-p|Discussion threads| Sivy on Stocks: Nasdaq crash victim|SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com December 4, 2000  ========================================= CHAT TONIGHT: Monday, December 4 at 8pm ET, 5pm PT Michael Sivy identifies sectors and stocks that possess true value in a rocky market. AOL users go to Keyword: Live http://www.money.com/chat/ =========================================  Nasdaq crash victim  Applied Materials has fallen to fire-sale prices.  By Michael Sivy  The Dow may be down only 10 percent from its 52-week high, but the Nasdaq is in the middle of a screaming bear market, down nearly 50 percent from its high in March. Computer stocks have been among the hardest hit, particularly PC makers: Compaq is down 34 percent from its peak, Dell is off 68 percent and Gateway, 76 percent.  The weakness extends down the food chain. Intel, which counts on PC makers for a large slice of its semiconductor sales, has lost 56 percent. And Applied Materials [AMAT], the leading producer of semiconductor equipment, is off 66 percent.  I don't believe that the outlook for these stocks is nearly as bleak as their recent performance suggests. It's true that the crucial fourth-quarter season isn't looking very bright. And the most pessimistic analysts argue that PCs are becoming like television sets -- commodities distinguished only by price. Without the ability to charge premium prices for added bells and whistles, the thinking goes, already-thin profit margins will deteriorate even more. But over the next five years, sales for top companies in the PC sector are projected to grow 12 percent to 15 percent annually, and earnings could rise 16 percent to 20 percent or more.  The next few months may be trying, but they should offer investors great long-term buying opportunities. And the best one, to my mind, figures to be Applied Materials, which is capable of growing profits an average of 25 percent a year.  The stock's big drawback is its extraordinary volatility. Even when it looks cheap, it's capable of falling further if the technology sector is doing poorly. And since two-thirds of sales come from overseas, Applied Materials is fully exposed to the vagaries of international economics, from the weak euro to Asian financial problems. In fact, I've recommended the stock several times before at higher prices, only to watch it go even lower.  At this point, however, I don't see how it could fall much more. Analysts have reduced earnings estimates for the current fiscal year (ending Oct. 1, 2001) from $3.50 a share two months ago to as little as $2.10 today. But even based on these reduced estimates, at $38.50 a share the stock is trading at less than 19 times earnings, or just 0.8 times its long-term growth rate.  Business conditions may well be tough through the first half of 2001, and some analysts see the stock going as low as $33 or $34 before bottoming. But business conditions should improve by the second half. Given that the stock could easily trade at more than double today's price in a more favorable market, the potential upside looks 10 times greater than the downside.   ###  Post your comments on Michael's column at: http://www.money.com/depts/investing/sivy/index.html  To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks, go to: http://www.money.com/email/  Earning Releases and Calls For the latest corporate earnings releases and online conference calls click on: http://money.ccbn.com   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Special Internet Offer!!!

To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will  include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor,  Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron  Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

jones-t|Sent| Re: COORD ADMIN|The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great  seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet,  Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.   Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and  said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used  them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress  for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and  does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off  Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute  sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I  don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to  my select, special friends!  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

shapiro-r|California legal issues| Proposed Letter to WSJ|Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's  comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen  from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief "Letter to the  Editor" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of  the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New  York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing  so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter  is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not  as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki  or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.

mark_haedicke|All documents|Re: FCEL|With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:  1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first  draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it  with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.  2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am  aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on  that draft, but nothing has been signed.  3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the  initial draft of the "talking points" for the disclosure discusison. It is  new and has not been discussed internally yet.  4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity  have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is  handling the "State" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo  to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.  5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the  purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will  depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we  will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not  know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and  again request Kay to please advise us on that.  It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with  the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to  do.                                                                  Dan    	Mark E Haedicke 	09/25/2000 02:31 PM 		  		 To: Dan Lyons/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc:  		 Subject: FCEL  Dan, please prepare a list of items you think I should sign off on and then  set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team.     Mark ----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 09/25/2000 02:29 PM -----  	David W Delainey 	09/22/2000 06:32 PM 		  		 To: Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ozzie Pagan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Heather  Kroll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Charles Vetters/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffery Ader/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Cliff Baxter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff  Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron 		 Subject: FCEL  Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward  under the structure we have discussed.   FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that  vest based upon 60MW of orders;   - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about  the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that  call;   - the transaction is fully press released immediately.   CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide  the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development    opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;   - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing  at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.  I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all  press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory  filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we  manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

kate_symes|Corporate comm|Re: Futures Deal w/ Sempra|Hello, I just spoke with Joe Hunter.  His group is supposed to call you and  ask if you want to ADP the deal.  Then they notify the brokers to let them  know.    Joe Hunter's group will handle this part of the process in the  future.  In the future when these trades are entered into Enpower we would  like for you all to put a comment in the deal saying that it is a deal that  when physical off of the NYMEX.  We do not want to confirm these  transactions.  We sent a confirmation letter on this deal and that is what  caused all of the confusion.   Regardless if the deal has been ADP'd or not  we do not want to confirm these transactions since they were originally done  on the NYMEX.  So please let everyone know to put a note in the deal so we  won't confirm them and hopefully we won't have all of this confusion again in  the future.  Thanks for you help!  Let me know if you need me to do anything else. Melissa      Kate Symes                12/05/2000 12:33 PM  To: Melissa Ann Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Futures Deal w/ Sempra    I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for  our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has  gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who  talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully  solve this once and for all.  You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially  when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get  a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I  guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making  sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy  to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want  everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.  Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he  handled these deals in the past.

Sarah Bruck (Enron Legal Specialist) may have some documentation questions.     Thanks,   Kay  -----Original Message-----  From: Price, Wade R.  Sent: Tue 2/19/2002 2:23 PM  To: Mann, Kay  Cc: Dhont, Margaret; Hall, Bob M.; Dickson, Stacy E.; Richardson, Stacey; Germany, Chris; Kelly, Katherine L.  Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission    Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.   Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.   I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.  Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.  A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call.   Thanks  WRP   The following producers have been calling requested such letters:                                                                          Master Log  Producers               Contract        Contact         Phone           Status                  Comments   Seneca Gas Ltd. 96096115        John Seffe      818-884-2447    No Document             Sent termination notice to Fred LaGrasta 2/11/02.

errol_mclaughlin_jr|Announcements|Organization Announcement|Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.  With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.  These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.  These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

The guaranty will cover physical NG and physical Power.  Through working with the financial legal team, a format has been discussed that covers multiple products for physical and financial business across multiple Enron entities.  Ideally, this is probably the best format to have a counterparty use.  Pursuant to instructions, I am not sending out a format to this company without having a member of the legal team give me the ok.  I was hoping that we could all coordinate on the multi-product, multi-entity format and possibly use it on a going forward basis.

lay-k|All documents| Re: Sports Arena Deal|Mr. Galvan - I wanted to let you know that Mr. Lay is out of the office until  Monday, so he will not be able to see your e-mail until then.  Rosalee     GALVAN666@aol.com on 07/26/2000 03:10:24 PM To: Kenneth.Lay@enron.com cc: julie.mason@chron.com, osanchez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us  Subject: Sports Arena Deal   Dear Mr. Lay:              My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side this year. I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new arena that is not needed. Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147 http://www.galvan.org      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

dasovich-j|Sent| Summary of Western Gov's Energy Summit|Paul Kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the Western  Governor's Association  "Energy Summit" that took place today.  Paul will  follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer. The governors  issued the following recommendations:  California should immediately implement FERC's order issued last Friday and  aggressively pursue all available DSM and conservation opportunties. The Western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and  implementing DSM and efficiency opportunities. Increase supply as soon as possible. FERC should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that  price caps can cause in the industry. FERC should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the  price spikes in the first week of December. Work with the Bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new  administration is focused on the issue.  Hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region-wide cap until  California takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation  (e.g., reforming regs governing utility forward contracts).

thomas-p|Sent Items| FW: Press Release| 17 August 2001  Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by New York State Regulators  (London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580- megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks- off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.  International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project, including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.  "The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said Peter Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. "We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added.  For additional information, please contact:  Media contact: (Europe) Aarti Singhal +44 (0)20-7320-8681  Media & Investor contact: (United States) Paul Parshley +1 508-922-3124  Notes to Editors-  The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66 and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.  International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net) under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development. Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges is "IPR".

I think we  should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick  and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East  Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me  to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and  have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first?  The LM6000 position looks like this:  24 turbines allocated:  4 City of Austin 4 Enron South America 4 Las Vegas Cogen 6 Public Service of Colorado 6 Florida Merchant plant   Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to  a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks.  It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to  back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or  plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated  to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll  have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45%  residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the  process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to  monetize the entire position.  We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are  moving fairly slow.  I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you  when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking  to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM,  ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider  some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year  term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe  Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource  needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk  about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well.    Let me know your thoughts!

mark_taylor|5_00|Enron Online: Counterparty Authority|In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in detail.  1.  The Issue  The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12, i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim that the transaction is not binding because:  (a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or (b) execution of the application was not authorized.  This issue is not unique to Japan  There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to  contractual enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.  Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the  Electronic Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the  contract. (We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)  2.  Enron's Practice re EOL  Our understanding is that:  * Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.   Neither the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.  * Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking  if the signatory shows the title "director" alongside his name).  * If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application and issues a password.  * Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and none has yet been approved.  3.  Business Purposes  Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.  However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the  power of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.  The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by  a representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction falls within those purposes.  However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of "all incidental or ancillary business", it is common for companies to not make this inquiry except in the most major contracts.  With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because  often their business purposes are in fact limited.  Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does not contain "Kabushiki Kaisha" or "Yugen Gaisha" at the end of the name, to  make further inquiries.  4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law  The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the sense that:  (a)  Deemed Authority  The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party  to presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a contract by the company's "representative director".  This corresponds to the presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the  US and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.  It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted  by law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract  is still binding on the company.  (b)  Apparent Authority  In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority. Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:   "A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president, executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he  has authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no  power of representation."  Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to "general managers" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then applies the concept to "an employee who has been entrusted with certain types  of matters or specific matters."  Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262 (above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general  manager and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to  represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the  company's business for which they are responsible.  It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho) have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are responsible.  (e)  Holding Out  Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be bound by his/her action.  5.  Practical Considerations  In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law,  the following factors are relevant:  (a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal  It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the  presumption referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to insist on tracing the "chain of authority" of the signatory up to the representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual transactions.  (b)  Size of Transaction  The question is what transactions fall into the "major" or "unusual" category.  Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in  (c), (d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.  Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised  to be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written  confirmation of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.  (c)  Size of Company  While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case  of a smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.  (d)  Business Department of Signatory  The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.  (e)  Degree of Exposure  To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to  expose the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty  in the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a reasonably conservative approach.  (f)  Recent History  However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of reputation considerations.  (g) Identity of Addressee  The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant. For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department, but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary authority.  (h)  Internal Procedures  Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese rules are not out of line with those of other countries.  Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent  approach to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's  unique regime of company titles.  6.  Conservative Approach  If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for  the counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:  * The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative director.  * A certified copy of the seal register.  * A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the representative director.  7.  Less Conservative Approach  Major Companies  For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which would not be out of line with market practice:  * The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho) of the relevant department or above, or  * By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.  A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho),  but this is right "on the line" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there  is some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an apparent authority argument.  Smaller Companies  For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.  Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for dividing between small and large companies.  8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies  Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view  but, taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any  company is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach, particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with  the correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no applications have yet been approved.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or  trading of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.   Under Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.  Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties  may make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In  most simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy  product Y should be enough in this context.  In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should  be carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to  the question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example, the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click  on an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further,  with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able  to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.  If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or  U.K. law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions, including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.   > > 3.

haedicke-m|Notes inbox| Municipality Draft Memo|Mark  Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please  call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with  John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this  policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this  afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial  trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is  written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally,  it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should  distribute the memo.

dasovich-j|Sent Items| Couple things|Greetings Dan:  Few things.  Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville. Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them. Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers? Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?  Have a great holiday weekend.  Best, Jeff   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Also, Randy needs some guidance on what sort of description  of the underlying investment is appropriate. I'm sure Randy can attach  something in his file that works just fine (as opposed to preparing something  for this). Also, you and Randy need to discuss how the fairness opinion is  used and whether it's provided to LJM to help support the swap price. Thanks!     Gordon McKillop@ENRON 09/26/2000 09:36 AM To: Randy Young/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Scott Sefton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: URGENT -- Re: Papers for Raptor Meeting Tuesday    To follow up on Scott's message below.  The attached proposal sheet has the  entity information for the Raptor II structure.  The proposal sheet should  contain the information that is necessary to support the confirm.  The asset  description should describe the business or entity.  A specific description  of the underlying investment and interest in should also be included.  Under  the detail of the derivative include the type (at the money price return  swap, put, call...), term, legal name, specific investment type (type of  stock, warrant ...), initial price, initial shares, initial notional value.   The valuation support should be attached with the proposal sheet.  For this  transaction, there is no premium calculation since the swap is at the money.    Please provide this information to Sara and me.  I will distribute the  information to Ryan and Scott.  After the confirm is completed, I will submit  the information to the counterparty for approval.  Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Gordon     Scott Sefton@ECT 09/26/2000 08:37 AM To: Randy Young/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Gordon McKillop/NA/Enron@ENRON   Subject: URGENT -- Re: Papers for Raptor Meeting Tuesday  Randy,  Hedges in the Raptor structure require that a Proposal Sheet be submitted to  the counterparty to the swap (the counterparty is owned by an outside  investor and our agreement with them requires this). Attached to Mary's email  below is the Raptor Derivative Proposal Sheet that the business unit will  need to submit. Gordon is responsible for this process and can answer any  questions you have.  Also attached below is a Raptor Securities/Confidentiality Response Form that  ENA legal prepared to help them conduct a due diligence exercise on their  merchant assets being hedged to confirm that there were no contractual or  other legal restrictions that may affect their ability to enter into the  swap. Although  many of the items on this form won't be relevant to what  you're hedging, I thought it may be helpful. Because we're not familiar with  the assets or any South American legal issues that may apply, we'll be  looking to you for confirmation that there aren't any issues in this regard.  You can ignore the document entitled Raptor Process for Inclusion of Swaps  into Raptor Vehicles.  Please call me or Gordon if you have any questions. Thanks!

drew_fossum|Notes inbox|Kern River Announces Expansion|Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators   posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000   Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with  FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its  922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide  additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will  provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for  firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate  Program, the company said.  "A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power  generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said  Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest  Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor  stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming,  restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80  million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.        *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

michelle_lokay|All documents|Re: download basis differential for TW (rms_basis table)|Gary, Changes related to TW basis differential for TW Deal Analysis is completed.  Michelle Lokay has reviewed the new index price using the new tables and  logic.   The migration does not  impact other applications.  Please approve it and  forward it to Margaret Waters mail box.      Margaret, Per your instruction, these are things we need for this migration.  1. Delete view rms_basis_nymex_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms 2. Create new view view rms_basis_nymex_partial_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and  ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms 3. Modify  the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull  from the new view 4. Migrate stored procedures      mchen.up_TWDA_create_path     mchen.up_TWDA_deal_analysis     in etstest/twprod01 to dbo in etstest/twprod01, etsmo/twprod01, and  mojo/twprod01.     Grant exec to developers in etstest.     Grant exec to TWDP in etsmo and mojo.   Thanks, Mei-Ling ---------------------- Forwarded by Meiling Chen/ET&S/Enron on 12/04/2000  02:34 PM ---------------------------   Margaret Waters 11/29/2000 10:23 AM To: Mei-Ling Chen/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: download basis differential for TW (rms_basis table)    Mei-Ling,  I put the index table on ETSTEST.twprod01, ETSMO.twprod01, and MOJO.twprod01  and I have added a job to refresh the new table in production.  In  development (ETSHOUSD11.GPGRMS) I have dropped the view rms_basis_nymex_view  and created a new view  rms_basis_nymex_partial_view.  I have also loaded the  data to ETSTEST.twprod01.  After you have tested and when you request the  migration, please request the deletion of the view rms_basis_nymex_view on  ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms and the creation of the new view in these  two environments.  Also request the modification of the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO  misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull from the new view.  Please send the request directly to my mail box, I will complete and send to  the ETS DBA mailbox as completed.  Margaret    Meiling Chen 11/21/2000 04:57 PM To: Margaret Waters/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: download basis differential for TW (rms_basis table)     Yes, I need the same logic for "NYMEX" like the attached query.  For NYMEX,  and the four new TW index, I only need the most current data for the application.   Thanks, Mei-Ling    Margaret Waters 11/21/2000 03:04 PM To: Mei-Ling Chen/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Kenagy Garyenagy/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Kim Kouri/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: download basis differential for TW (rms_basis table)    Meiling,  Do you want the same logic you have in the attached query for the "NYMEX"  also or like the current NYMEX selection do you want everything and you  filter the most current?  Also for the future, creation of new tables require a database change form.  Thanks,  Margaret    Meiling Chen 11/14/2000 05:58 PM To: Margaret Waters/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Kenagy Garyenagy/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Kim Kouri/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: download basis differential for TW (rms_basis table)   Margaret ,  The basis differential for TW is available in rms database now, I like to  request a nightly download from rms database to twprod01 database in etstest/etsmo/mojo. You set up NYMEX price dowload to rms_basis for me ealier. Since there are more than one type of index coming in this time, I think we  also need rms_index in Sybase side.

lokay-m|All documents| Holiday Safety Reminder|HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER  The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential  for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown  shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office  parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the  City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.  £ Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.   This defeats security.   £ Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do  not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major  fire hazards when they dry out.  £ Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves  who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer  people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see  someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call  the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.  £ Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer  or closet.  £ If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload  yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe  place.  £ Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don, t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.  £ When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a  card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.   £ If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages  or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you  as to company guidelines.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

smith-m|Discussion threads| hi|Sara,  Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all  rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week,  and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been  extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I  haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning  which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for  the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into  the phone?  Stupid drunk?    Mat   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

michelle_lokay|Discussion threads|Synopsis Article: Notes on FERC's Conference on Competitive Natural Gas Markets|Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market   Just so you'll know: "The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC  has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be  unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best  market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across  dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of," Robert Levin  of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday.   "The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of  market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants,  using an extraordinary selection of market instruments," Levin continued,  adding that the Commission should be supporting the "growth and increased  sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now."   Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long  conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the  electric market, Levin cautioned, "liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't  overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural  gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow  the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric  market.   "Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change  the electric market," which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on  the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market.   But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the  more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at  FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of  initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline  transportation.   Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the  existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away  with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead  rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs  between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered  by mostly pipeline customers.   However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased  competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC  staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. "...[W]e're  concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in  pipeline transportation. The two are not the same," said Arthur Corbin on  behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents  municipal gas distributors.   "Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in  [the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a  regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate," he said.   Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy  practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented  the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He  agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added "there's not  a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location.  Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the  near future..." Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to  protect producers from market power that accompanies "limited access" to  pipelines.   The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of  several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the  Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets.   Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies,  urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market  liquidity as the "ultimate goal" at the expense of the transportation market.  Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and  construction of "optimal amounts of additional capacity" to meet the needs of  the market. "The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the  natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation  capacity."   Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment,  saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and  elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity  to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce  energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted.   Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the  development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed  to develop at their "own pace," and at locations where the market "sees fit,"  he said.   EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 "liquid and transparent" market centers  exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily  under "extremely competitive" conditions. He said he's "confident" more will  be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As  another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio --- as well as others ---  supported eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, which requires the  customer to retain title to the gas while it's being shipped. Doing away with  the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and  services, such as operational balancing and virtual storage, he told the FERC  staff.   But Dena Wiggins, an attorney with the D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &  Brennan LLP, which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group (industrial gas  customers), said her group was "very concerned" about efforts to repeal the  rule. "...I haven't heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns  that we might have." She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions  to the shipper-must-have-title rule in certain cases, and should continue  with this policy where necessary.   Moreover, Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about  the mounting market power of unregulated companies, especially gas marketers.   At the conference, she also expressed her group's dismay with the pipeline  compliance filings with Order 637, particularly on the penalty issue. Rather  than an "improved" penalty structure, pipelines are proposing higher  penalties, Wiggins said. "[We] continue to be shocked at the absolute  wholesale departures" from 637.   BP's Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services  outlined by pipelines in their Order 637 filings, which he said were "nothing  more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can't  refuse." He urged the Commission to check with a pipeline's customers, noting  one proposed new "service" is opposed by 100% of the pipeline's  non-affiliated customers. Some of the proposed services, Holligan said, add  up to nothing more than degradation of existing long-term firm service.   Holligan, representing the largest producer in the U.S. and Canada, joined  other market participants in urging adoption of "standardized allocation  (sales), standardized penalty levels, and the requirement that all pipelines  implement a uniform title transfer tracking process." In short,  "standardizing pipeline services, certainly on an individual pipeline, and  also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets  are to be highly liquid..Individually negotiated services, where every  service is a different service, or the adoption of a so-called dual track  market, are the antithesis of a highly liquid, efficient and competitive gas  market. Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary  to facilitate trading through e-commerce."   "The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can  be traded along with gas electronically," Holligan said.    *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time  because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the  existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next  week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather  information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and  Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional  Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names  to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments  were as follows:  The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by  the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors  The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for  several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain  additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond  their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC  Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if  they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.    We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the  meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just  observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the  major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division  represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining  why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' &  Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts  in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps'  responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts'  managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate  objectively for the individual. Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or  impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.    I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they  should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.  Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis ===============================================================  Last Wednesday, PG&E Co. proposed a five-year "rate stabilization plan" that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than $3 billion in power costs incurred last summer. Under PG&E's plan, submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for approval, average  residential bills of $54.50 would increase to about $63.50 a month as of Jan. 1, 2001. This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes after an existing rate freeze ends by 2002. However, a portion of the increase also would go to paying down the $3.4 billion in unforeseen charges that PG&E insists are not the utility's responsibility.  ANALYSIS: Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this past summer focused on San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), the legacy of the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PG&E and Southern California Edison (SCE), as both utilities have yet to fully enter competitive markets within the state. This latest proposal from PG&E is an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently carries.  Let's first understand how PG&E found itself in the red, since this is critical to the utility's argument that customers should be responsible for the debt.  Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in its service territory, PG&E must its power on the wholesale market. In addition, under California's restructuring mandates, PG&E had to buy its power out of the Power Exchange (PX) rather than establishing bi-lateral contracts with suppliers. The combination of low supply and high demand drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer, which PG&E faced as a buyer. Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect, PG&E has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers. Although reports vary, on average PG&E has been paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market, when by law it is only allowed to charge its customers on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  As a result of these factors, PG&E has paid about $3.4 billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers, and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's motivation in wanting relief from its debt, and also its argument that*since it was obligated to buy the power for customers in the first place*its customers should ultimately carry the burden for the high costs.  PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest, or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid, something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs are already paid off. Consequently, PG&E has been lobbying to the CPUC for several months for various options that would all result in PG&E customers picking up the $3.4 billion tab. The utility first proposed to retroactively bill customers for the debt. This latest proposal changes the course a bit to provide for a rate increase, but the end result would essentially be the same.  Under the proposal, PG&E's rate freeze would end Jan. 1, 2001, and residential and small business customers would begin paying 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for five years, compared with the current wholesale costs of 15.2 cents per kilowatt hour (generation costs). Without such a rate stabilization plan in place, PG&E warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more than $108 after the rate freeze is lifted. The utility also contends that the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summer's high prices amounts to less than 20 percent of the total monthly increases. To reduce the impact on low-income customers, the utility plans to increase their discount to 25 percent from the 15 percent they currently receive. PG&E said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates proved not to be high enough to cover costs. If the deficit of uncollected costs grew by $1 billion, for example, then rates at the start of 2002 would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around 15 percent to 7.5 cents.  Skeptics*including some within the CPUC*say PG&E is simply looking to protect its own interests. Carl Wood, a CPUC commissioner, referred to PG&E's proposal as "volume two of their bailout request" and noted that the request results in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the utility's debt. The consumer group TURN contends that PG&E, and not customers, is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred. The group also argues that, although PG&E has cast its proposal under a guise of customer  protection, the proposal only really serves to assure PG&E of full recovery of its debt. In addition, TURN noted that PG&E submitted its proposal to the CPUC on the day before Thanksgiving, conceivably to downplay media attention and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC.  PG&E remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt, and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal. PG&E believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers for debt it believes it accrued on its customers' behalf.  PG&E's proposal comes at a time when the utility's reputation has taken a beating. A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that the CPUC received more than 17,000 complaints about PG&E from 1997 to 1999. According to the report, PG&E received more than three times as many  complaints per customer as SDG&E during the past three years, which is quite significant considering that SDG&E customers were exposed to bills that increased by two and three times their normal amounts last summer. The comparison between PG&E and SDG&E was made because they are the only major private utilities in the state to offer both electric and gas service.  PG&E also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide. From 1997 to 1999, PG&E complaints represented 56 percent of the total filed with the CPUC, even though it only has 39 percent of gas customers and 46 percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the state. Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PG&E concerned billing problems. In its own defense, PG&E claims that it faces a unique set of weather-related conditions that make the service it provides to customers more fraught with problems, which consequently results in more complaints.  It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PG&E's request, but prior comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility's proposal will be rejected. This casts a dark shadow over the future of PG&E as, without being able to bill customers for its debt, it is uncertain how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent. Ironically, unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PG&E Corp. continue to perform well and show profits. Yet, the huge debt of PG&E Co. may become an overwhelming anchor around the parent company's neck in the very near future. ============================================================== SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need.

Talk about sticker shock. That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with kids, that figure leads to wild fantasies about all the things we could have bought, all the places we could have traveled, all the money we could have banked if not for (insert child's name here).  For others, that number might confirm the decision to remain childless.  But $160,140.00 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a week. That's a mere $24.44 a day.  Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't have children if you want to be rich.  It's just the opposite.  There's no way to put a price tag on: Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump of a knee rippling across your skin. Having someone cry, "It's a boy!" or shout, "It's a girl!" then hearing the baby wail and knowing all that matters is it's healthy. Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the first time.  Feeling the warmth of fat cheeks against your breast. Cupping an entire head in the palm of your hand. Making out dada or mama from all the cooing and gurgling.  What do you get for your $160,140.00? Naming rights. First, middle and last. Glimpses of God every day. Giggles under the covers every night. More love than your heart can hold. Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs. Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds and warm cookies. A hand to hold, usually covered with jam. A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sandcastles and skipping down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.  Someone to laugh yourself silly with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that day.  For $160,140.00, you never have to grow up.  You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs and never stop believing in Santa Clause.  You have an excuse to keep reading the adventures of Piglet and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney movies and wishing on stars.  You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers under refrigerator magnets and collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay for Mother's Day and cards with backward letters for Father's Day.  For $160,140.00, there's no greater bang for your buck.  You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a sliver, filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of bangs and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always gets treated to ice cream regardless.  You get a front-row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word, first bra, first date, first time behind the wheel.  You get to be immortal. You get another branch added to your family tree, and if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called grandchildren.  You get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice, communications and human sexuality no college can match.  In the eyes of a child, you rank right up there with God.  You have the power to heal a boo-boo, scare away monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a slumber party, ground them forever and love them without limits, so one day they will, like you, love without counting the cost.      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

forney-j|Sent Items| More questions|  Mark, Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO. He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.  We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.  However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market. The replacement reserve prices have been zero.  Could you provide some help on this?  Thanks,  J Forney      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

kevin_ruscitti|Inbox|TEXAS GETS CAUGHT UP IN A POWER PLAY -Energy Alley to blame for California's wo|      _____     Previous	 Next	 Return to Hitlist	 Return to Search Screen <http://www.chron.com/content/archive/qsearch.hts?operation=search&user=houston&sview=1&hview=1&dview=2>	 HOUSTON CHRONICLE ARCHIVES     Paper: Houston Chronicle Date: TUE 06/05/01 Section: HOUSTON Page: 8 Edition: 2 STAR  TEXAS GETS CAUGHT UP IN A POWER PLAY /Energy Alley to blame for California's woes?   By ANN HODGES, Houston Chronicle TV Critic Staff    Frontline joins hands with the New York Times tonight, to jump into what California Gov. Gray Davis has turned into a marathon news blast at Texas, and at Houston, over his state's energy woes.   Frontline : Blackout, airing at 10 tonight, should have Davis and his bash-Texas troops giving each other high fives.   In its opening minutes, Frontline 's narration sets a tone for Texas-bashing:   "Investigators (otherwise unidentified) claim that a handful of energy companies siphoned billions from consumers while the lights (in California) were out.   "If you want to understand the story of electric power in America today, you have to follow the electrons and follow the money. It's a story that starts here, in Houston, Texas."   The blame game is in high gear, as Frontline 's dust-up hovers over Houston.   Houston's Energy Alley, home of "electric cowboys" (Frontline 's words), is the focus of this "follow-the-money" trail.   And Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, "the 800-pound gorilla" in the Alley, gets the major grilling in its high-powered interview hot seat, along with Enron CEO Jeff Skilling.   Interviewees also include Vice President Dick Cheney, California and federal officials, other company executives, industry insiders and what Frontline calls "whistle-blowers."   Politics and finger-pointing fuel charges and countercharges, with Frontline correspondent and New York Times contributor Lowell Bergman conducting the interviews, and an off-camera narration spinning the sound and fury.   With blackouts expected to hit New York this summer, "the entire country will soon be short on power," Frontline asserts to set the stage.   "The generators have made more money than God. I mean, they've made 7, 8, 900 percent profit," Davis charges.   "Now that a fellow Texan sits in the White House," Frontline says, "the companies on Energy Alley are hoping things will only get better. . . . Lay is a personal friend and big backer of President Bush, and he and his executives have been the Bush family's most generous contributors. . . . "   "There are a few of us that are still maybe idealistic enough to think that we can kind of support a candidate because we really believe in the individual," Lay counters. "We believe in their policies. We believe in the direction they are going to take the country."   El Paso Corp., the largest natural gas company, gets its lumps, too, from California officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was ready to dismiss California's complaint of price manipulation at the state's borders, Frontline says, "until Frontline and the New York Times obtained sealed documents revealing discussions at El Paso's highest levels."   "Those documents are irrelevant," El Paso spokeswoman Peggy Heeg says.   Frontline passes its golden opportunity to lay out, clearly and concisely, both sides - what critics say are the self-inflicted origins of California's energy crisis, and California's charges of price-gouging and pleas for price caps. Instead, that information comes piecemeal, over the course of contentious and often-confusing exchanges.   To avoid retreat on deregulation, now in progress in 24 states, companies have begun to raise the possibility of settlement with California, Frontline reports. In Lay's opinion, "It's still going to take a comprehensive settlement of the whole issue, all the issues" - including money.   Give Frontline full credit for stepping in where no other TV news outlet has dared to tread in such depth. Something is surely better than nothing.   But this Frontline /New York Times team coverage effort does not cool the blame game. It sheds more heat than light.   Frontline : Blackout, 10 tonight, 9 p.m. June 12 on Channel 8. Grade: B.

(AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my  schedule).

The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The  Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.

zipper-a|charges| Charges|Andy,  When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which  we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?  I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation,  but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic  benefit.  These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e.  new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the  incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.  If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the  guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's  allocation.  What do you think?

shapiro-r|All documents| California Update p.2; 5/29/01|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY £ Senator Keeley Spearheads a New "Plan B" £ State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy  Keeley's Collective "Plan B" Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed  out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan "as  soon as possible"; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not  this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans  were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they  developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).   However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough  Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much  tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will  be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people  who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.   Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez "Plan B's," Keeley's new  plan is said to: £ Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their  undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to "high-end  customers."  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who  would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate  component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to  12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component  for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that  will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional  dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to  cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward  purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation  should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key  question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of  power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to  continue operating. £ The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission  assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan  would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on  the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an  incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it  would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the  value would be credited toward the loan. £ In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the  filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power  generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to  pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct  access to power. If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the  constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go  forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that  the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.   Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission  assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would  become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.  Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding "Plan B" and the  legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering  Keeley's "Plan B" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the  Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of  bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking  seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans  remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of  PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain).   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

ring-r|Inbox| FORWARD PRICE VIEWS FOR COMPETITIVE ENERGY MARKETS|  Link to www.ze.com  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   Forward Price Views for Competitive Energy Markets  [IMAGE] 	   [IMAGE]   Dear Jubran,   Recognizing the pronounced volatility and uncertainty  in the energy industry, ZE PowerGroup has developed processes and  tools to facilitate dynamic trading and risk management. One of  the foremost tools required for competitive operation is the availability  of representative forward natural gas and power views for the various  market hubs.   Given that generation resource development, price behavior and  industry responsiveness has been significantly outside of historic  norms established during the extended period of regulation, and  given recent world events have resulted in greater uncertainty in  the economy it is critical that an organization be able to probabilistically  predict future prices, with some degree of accuracy.  The market is always asking itself questions like:   Should I commit to a deal now or wait?  For how much and for how long should I commit? What is the impact of this transaction on my portfolio? How do market events impact near, mid and long term pricing? How long will the price remain at the current level?  A forward view is a prerequisite to manage and optimize on an energy  portfolio in competitive markets. ZE PowerGroup provides short,  mid and long-term Forward Price Views. The Forward Price Views are  developed using sophisticated, top-down market simulation models  that are readily customizable and adaptable in size and scope to  any region in North America. The Forward Price Models have been  designed using the key drivers and fundamental parameters of the  natural gas and electrical power industries in combination with  econometric techniques and expert judgment. The value of the model  is in its ability to extract and quantify the expert judgment.  The difference between the ZE PowerGroup Forward Price Model and  other models is that of a top-down market simulation versus bottom-up  generation modeling. The bottom-up generation model does not always  account for market behavior and assumes that generation is predominantly  economically. These modes make little or no allowance for market  power, inefficiencies, gaming or other operational or unique market  factors.  ZE PowerGroup developed their first price views in 1996. The Forward  Price Model has performed well as a guiding tool; the views created  from the models have consistently predicted the direction of price  movement in the markets. It was one of the few models that predicted  rapid and consistent price increases after deregulation when the  industry consensus was that prices would retreat. Clients who have  incorporated the price views into their strategic planning have  reaped significant benefits and mitigated price risks; fairing better  than their counterparts.  The Forward Price Model can be coupled with the Market Monitoring  subscription, which adds value through targeted intelligence required  to optimize positioning in uncertain and volatile markets.  ZE PowerGroup strives to provide timely and required intelligence  at reasonable cost.  For more information on ZE PowerGroup's Forward Price Views  or on subscribing to a monthly market monitoring service, please  visit our web page at www.ze.com ,  contact us by email at paul@ze.com   or by phone at 604-244-1469.

As you know we will be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to bring our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are working with Duke, and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Breakfast (donuts, muffins, kolaches, coffee) on both floors to welcome everyone in the morning.  Happy Hour celebration with the group.     I have looked into: Sambuca Jazz Cafe http://sambucahouston.citysearch.com/  We can have the place to ourselves from 3-5 and we could move the party to the 2nd floor after 5:00.  Audrey would prefer that we keep it to a two drink minimum.  They can have drink tickets available upon arrival.  We can have a selection of appetizers available and we could also arrange to pay for valet parking.  With a high estimate of 600 people here are the following cost estimates:  Food, Beverage, Valet*, Tax, and Gratuity - $29.22 per person Same as above minus valet* - $27.22 per person  *Valet was only for an estimate of 200 cars  I'm ready to roll with the arrangements, and told Audrey I would keep her in the loop regarding arrangements.

I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10 times easier than Colorado slopes.  Needless to say, I'm a little nervous about how well I will do.  But I am extremely excited about going.  When I did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues successfully and one black semi-successfully.  My biggest fear of all is the cold.  I HATE COLD WEATHER!!  It should be interesting.  On top of it, I'm extremely excited becase this will be my first vacation I have EVER taken. Yipppeee!!!

cash-m|Data protection| RE: Model Contract Question|Each Data Protection Supervisory Authority can be contacted; some may review. We are not aware of one supervisory authority that can bind all authorities in all states with its approval of a contract. But if you are not required by law to pre-submit your contract, I question whether you want to do so.  You may get multiple interpretations. We believe that you should develop your best judgment about whether your documents conform to the legal requirements and submit the contract where you are required to do so, not seek advice from the regulatory authorities about the specifics of your contracts.  After all, as we indicated this area of the law is still in flux, and we would hate to see you lock into a position with an authority--unless you absolutely had to do so.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Term : Initial term of 5 years, with an additional 5 year term at e prime's election. Notification 6 months before end of contract Interconnect: On Pressure Control, range from +/- 85,000. Any significant change in volume to be communicated between two control 	rooms if after hours. Gas can be transported from West Texas, Central Texas, or Midcontinent Pools to this TW-Nichols connection. OBA will allow for +/- 10,000 mmbtu/day, maximum of +/-100,000 mmbtu/d Imbalance outside of the above will be moved on/off the next business day Up to 30,000 mmbtu/d can be exchanged from TW-Nichols to other Xcel/Utility plants on NNG. Transport charges will be same as this 	transport. The TW-NNG exchange volumes will count toward the annual commitments. Any volumes above this amount will be 	at mutually agreed upon transport charges. Any volumes above the 10 BCF specified in Bob's brief letter, will be made at a mutually agreeable demand charge plus fuel if applicable. Transport fuel is currently at 1.31%, but could change in future years.   Is there storage on TW ??? The JV between NNG and E Prime will not preclude this agreement.

mann-k|Sent| Re: SPA: Illinois Project Entities|No TurboPark?  No GE or ABB issues?  I feel like I'm missing something....  I'll get up to speed asap.  Kay     Fred Mitro@ECT 01/24/2001 05:26 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Rusty Stevens/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: SPA: Illinois Project Entities    Kay:  As we discussed, I have been working with a counterparty interested in  purchasing one or both of ENA's Illinois development project LLC's.  The  counterparty is listed below:   PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C.   35 Waterview Blvd.   Parsippany, NJ  94105  The key points of the proposed transaction are:  1.  The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member  interests in one or both of the following project entities:   Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.  Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.  2.  The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be:   Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00  Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00  Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG  before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at  Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities  Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.   Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but  Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.  I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in  proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy  of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the  Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.  I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and  transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA  once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago  tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a  voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.  Thanks, Fred     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

haedicke-m|All documents| ENA Legal Budget @ August 31, 2000|FYI.  I am working on new procedures requiring a "budget" for outside counsel  on our more complex deals to improve cost control.  Mark ----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 10/03/2000 05:20 PM -----  	Deb Korkmas 	10/03/2000 09:08 AM 		  		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc:  		 Subject: ENA Legal Budget @ August 31, 2000  I have reviewed the O&M Expenses for ENA Legal for month-ended August 31,  2000, as compared to the budgeted amount for the same period.  The overall  legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to  Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.  The most  significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant  development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and  misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.  The Inside Costs were  under budget in the amount of $259,654.  If you have any questions, please call me at extension 35448.   Deb Korkmas Enron North America Corp.

sanders-r|All documents| Re: Enron/Ponderosa: Proposed Langauge|PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION  I spoke with Deutsche bank immediately after my conversation with Dan Lyons.   I apologize as I must not have communicated clearly that I understood the  importance of this issue from a legal point of view.  My intent on having  language proposed was not to concede to any proposed language by Deustche but  to determine if it was possible to be assured of bringing in a significant  commitment to the syndication of the transaction as well as not create any  potential legal issues.  As this was not the case, I told Deutche that after  reviewing their proposed documentation, we could not make the change and that  they should come into the transaction and hold the entire $35MM amount and  hold that amount rather than syndicating it out the back end as initially  contemplated.          Dan Lyons 10/27/2000 03:21 PM To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carl Tricoli/Corp/Enron@Enron,  abaskins@llgm.com, tmoore@llgm.com, Garrick Hill/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Brian Kerrigan/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Enron/Ponderosa: Proposed Langauge  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL  ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION   KBC is apparently having trouble syndicating the Cornhusker deal and one of  the potential syndicees, Deutsche Bank, didn't like the way our deal was  structured thinking it wasn't as good a deal for the banks as a different  Enron deal they were in.  I think at least some of us have talked about this  before and I am reluctant, given the posture of Brazos at the current moment  to do even de minimis or seemingly non- controversial or harmless changes to  the documents because I don't know how it might be construed or twisted  against us in  a litigation scenario..having said that, I think this one does  two things..it gives DB a right to step in and act onits own behalf if Enron  doesn't pay...this seems to me to be a clear change from a hardly maintained  position that we wanted to deal with one entity, not a dozen and in my view  is a change in the deal, but I guess is your call..the second change (I  think) adds some ability on the part of the banks to involve ponderosa in  remedial actions if there is non-payment...this seems to me to have the  advantage of reinforcing Ponderosa's status as an owner, but may not reflect  our deal with Ponderosa and to some extent is inconsistent with the Mantra we  have consistently had of Enron's credit being the credit which was being  bought...I note that I have made these observations from my memory of what  the docs say and request Lebouef to confirm my analysis or correct it...at  any rate if my analysis is correct I vote no, but I think we probably need a  group discussion early next week as they want to finalize the assignments on  Tuesday...Lebouef will be sending a separate memo about some other issues  that have been raised by the proposed assignments...it seems to me that our  original deal is being steadily chipped away and I really worry about it in  light of the strained relations with Brazos  ----- Forwarded by Dan Lyons/HOU/ECT on 10/27/2000 03:01 PM -----  	marcus.tarkington@db.com 	10/27/2000 01:55 PM 		  		 To: brian.kerrigan@enron.com, Sarah.Heineman@enron.com, dan.lyons@enron.com 		 cc:  		 Subject: Enron/Ponderosa: Proposed Langauge     Brian, as we discussed attached is the proposed language to be added to the Assignment Agreement to address the DB policy issue. Also, the language will facilitate the loan saleability and therefore  included in the Assignment Agreement when we sell the loan.  As indicated in the note our counsel is  reviewing the Assignment Agreement which we just recently received from Mayer, Brown.  After  you and your counsel have reviewed the language below please give me a  call. 212 250-7684 Thanks ---------------------- Forwarded by Marcus Tarkington on 10/27/2000 02:45 PM  ---------------------------   Margaret M Ross@DBNA 10/27/2000 03:17 PM  To:   Marcus Tarkington@Bankers_Trust cc: Subject:  Enron/Ponderosa: Proposed Langauge  Set forth below for your consideration is proposed language relating to the  right of independent action that we have been discussing.  This language  would appear at the end of the draft Assignment Agreement as a final  provision to the Miscellaneous section.  Please note that I have not had the  opportunity to review the assignment and, as a result, the language set forth  below remains subject to our review of this proposed agreement:            (n)  Notwithstanding anything else provided herein or in any Loan  Document or the Swap Agreement, the parties hereto acknoledge and agree  that:  (i) the term "Party B" (as such term is used in Section 13(b) of the  Swap Agreement) shall mean and be a reference to (A) the Agent, and/or (B) in  the case of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to  any failure by Enron Corp. to make, when due, any payment specified under  Section 5(a)(i) of the Swap Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof,  any Lender; and (ii) the term "party" or "parties" (as such term is used in  Section 13(b) of the Swap Agreement), in the case of any Dispute referred to  in clause (i)(B) above, shall include any such Lender.

For you information, I have also attached the list of confirmed participants to date.  Doug, based on your last e-mail, we would like to invite Dr Lay to speak in the session "Globalization and Liberalization" on Monday afternoon.  Please let me know if you agree and if either you or Rosalee could check with him to see if he is of the same opinion and if he accepts, I would greatly appreciate this.  Or let me know if he would prefer to speak in another session.  Rosalee, we have Dr Lay already confirmed for two sessions within the main Annual Meeting programme, the B-2-B session and "The shape of the 21st Century Corporation"  as soon as I know the exact dates and times - I will let you know immediately in order to re-confirm.

stclair-c|Sent| Dresdner Bank|Rhett: I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directly  about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the  language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.  I have enclosed below  the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not  accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps.   Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier for  the tax folks to talk directly to each other.

ring-r|EESIISOPJM| MD Index Product - Revised Product Approval Template and Confirmation|Richard,  Here's a version that reflects changes we discussed this afternoon. I've deleted the Energy Supply Option section from the Product Approval Template since the provision does not exist in the TC or Master Agreement.  A metering Special Term and Condition has been added to this draft.  The EESI section is now more broad regarding the quarterly billing adjustment.  I didn't add language to the "Conversion to Fixed" section yet.  I'm not sure how to word what you wanted...any suggestions?   This revised TC hasn't been reviewed by Mike Smith yet, so if you have any specific changes please let me know.        Thanks!

ruscitti-k|Inbox| VERY IMPORTANT ENRONONLINE  STACK MANAGER CHANGES| We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes  1. Changes to Stack Manager:  1.1 Changes to toolbar icons: To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:     1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.  To activate this feature: 1. Select a product and click on Product Properties 2. Check the Enable box 3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values 4. Click Update Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00  You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.   Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.   2. Changes to EnronOnline Website  (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)  The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:  2.1 Today's Transactions  Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.  Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order.   Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.  2.2 Submission Box  The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of "zeros" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

jones-t|Sent| Assignment of Fletcher Challenge Swaps; Response to inquiry	letter|Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.   Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather  quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to  proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe  give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know.  ----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/20/2001 10:37 AM -----  	"Robert Viguet" <rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com> 	02/19/2001 07:30 PM 		  		 To: <tana.jones@enron.com> 		 cc: <david.taylor@apachecorp.com>, <jeff.king@apachecorp.com> 		 Subject: Assignment of Fletcher Challenge Swaps; Response to inquiry letter   Tana:  This email is just a follow-up on the telephone message that I left for you  earlier today.  As I explained, our firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) represents  Apache Corporation and I will be replacing Saul Laureles in concluding our  work related to the assignment of certain natural gas price swaps from  Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited ("Fletcher Challenge") to Shell  Overseas Holdings Limited ("Shell"), and the reassignment from Shell to  Apache Corporation. My contact information is as follows:  Robert J. Viguet, Jr. ("Bert") Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White Williams & Martin 1200 Smith Street, Suite 1400 Houston, Texas 77056 Telephone:  713-654-9693 FAX:   713-658-2553 rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com  You should have received a letter from Saul Laureles dated February 6, 2001  via overnight courier requesting that your firm confirm certain facts related  to the swaps to be assigned as described above.  We are looking for a written  response to that inquiry at your earliest opportunity.  If there are any  errors or other discrepancies in the list of swap transactions or other  matters identified in the letter, we need to know as soon as possible so that  there will be time to resolve those issues before the assignments are made.  This firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) has prepared a draft of the Assignment and  Assumption Agreements for the transfer of the swaps from Fletcher Challenge  to Shell and from Shell to Apache Corporation. Our draft of the assignment  forms is being reviewed by attorneys for Shell now, but should be available  for your review in a few days. The acquisition of assets of Fletcher  Challenge Energy by Shell and Apache, and the related assignments of the swap  transactions, is expected to closes in early March.  If you have any questions or comments concerning the proposed transactions,  please don't hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our "reviewers" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.   Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.     Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.   -----Original Message----- From: Ray Kelm - Kelm Engineering  [mailto:ray@kelm-engr.com] Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 3:22  PM To: Robert Franson - Citizens Subject: preliminary  report Robert,   I had to delete a couple figures to get the size  below 1 meg to email.

corman-s|Sent Items| FW: Feedback on Presentation|I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.  This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......     -----Original Message----- From: 	Sumlin, Roger   Sent:	Tuesday, October 16, 2001 3:37 PM To:	Corman, Shelley Cc:	Horton, Stanley Subject:	Feedback on Presentation  Shelley . . .   Looking over my notes from the Operations Directors Conference, I am reminded of what a fine job you did delivering your presentation and I thought I'd provide you this feedback.  I felt you clearly conveyed your information in a manner that engaged the participants and helped them understand and retain your message.  Specifically, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctly with varying voice inflection and without "umms" (a very difficult thing to do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in your voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  Watching and listening, I both "liked" you and felt "sold" on the seriousness of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providing effective customer service.  To improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become "busy" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any one slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention.  Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpful new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were very effective.  Regards, - Roger  Copy:  Stan Horton (Note to Stan - I had to step out while you were speaking; so, please don't expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went just as well!)  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

In particular has Enron  completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the  Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to  hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file  something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the  possibility is out there.   ============================================================================== This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential  and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

steffes-j|California Issues| Re: California Contract Language|Thanks.  Comments below.  Great input.   From:	James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/16/2001 09:59 AM To:	Mike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES cc:	  Subject:	California Contract Language   Some thoughts --  1.	Why use the "Special" term?  Just call it DA Charges.  What makes these charges special.  Parallels the def we use of "Special Utility Charges."  Also connotes that these are often imposed outside the normal course of business. 2.	Why limit to "energy procurement" or "public purpose"?  For instance, if the Utilities were to implement a line item charge for past Negative CTC payments, I don't think your language would cover this. Isn't that "future payback of past under collections"?  Seems to me to relate to energy procurement--ie their avoided cost of energy procurement 3.	Does this include the potential for "positive CTC"?  We don't want to miss this cost.  Customer pays CTC as part of "T&D Charges."  CTC is expressly included in the definition of those charges. 4.	What do we do with post March 31, 2002 rate periods?  While the AB1890 rate freeze is premised to continue until March 31, 2002 or when generation-related stranded costs are recovered, we don't know what will be happening after then.  Want to make sure that any non-bypassable charge is paid by customers, including T&D, along with our generation rates.  All T&D is passed through to customer, regardless of when.  We have only priced "retail" generation on these deals.   5.	How does the concept of re-billing versus prospective rate adjustments get incorporated?  Maybe it gets built into the calculation of CTC, but want to make sure that the right value goes to the right party.  I think the rebilling as opposed to prospective will follow the allocation of charges in the contract.  We talk about things like "however styled or payable" to pick up things like that.  Jim   -----Original Message----- From: 	Smith, Mike   Sent:	Wednesday, August 15, 2001 4:20 PM To:	Steffes, James D. Subject:	   Jim--here is the relevant language.  Customer pays all "Special DA Charges."   "Special DA Charges" means any charges, fees, assessments, adders or surcharges imposed or authorized by any Governmental Authority on "direct access" customers (regardless of whether any such charge is also imposed on other classes or types of customers), however styled or payable, that are related to (i) a Utility's, ISO's or Governmental Authority's energy procurement, including, without limitation, charges for system reliability, rate recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortization of above market purchases and energy load repurchases; or (ii) public purpose programs, including, without limitation, environmental, social/low income, renewable energy utilization, and demand side management programs.  Such charges will apply regardless of whether the energy requirements of the Accounts are being supplied by us or the applicable Utility.     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

dasovich-j|Mba program| Spring 00 E202B|Hi Everyone,  For those of you who are in the Tuesday night E202B course (section 2) in the Spring semester, I would like to explain why the schedule had to be modified in the way it was.  At the last minute just before the schedule came out, the original instructor called to tell us that he would be unable to teach that section.  Brett Trueman, the Accounting Group Chair, worked very hard and very quickly to find a replacement.  Professor Sunil Udpa agreed to teach the course but needed to adjust the class meeting dates due to prior commitments.  I apologize that the schedule for this course is less than ideal - however, the tradeoff was quality of instruction versus convenience of class meetings.  Brett and I  chose quality.   At this point, we are unable to make any changes to the schedule.  Once again, I apologize for the less than ideal class schedule.  Regards,  Diane  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

bill_williams_iii|Personal|Re: Weights? nice.|Hey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so orange and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the Enron gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the meatheads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for you (maybe 9ish).   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

jeffrey_a_shankman|All documents|EE&CC Organizational Changes|What do you think? ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000  08:06 AM ---------------------------   Eric Gonzales 10/20/2000 04:13 AM To: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: EE&CC Organizational Changes   Jeff,  The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was  previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other  engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.    If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave  Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys  are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple  of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley  leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron  Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of  Izzo's guys).    If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this  is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.  Thanks Eric ---------------------- Forwarded by Eric Gonzales/LON/ECT on 20/10/2000 09:58  ---------------------------  Office of the Chairman From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 19/10/2000 17:24 CDT To: All Enron Worldwide cc:   Subject: Organizational Changes  Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the  engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron  Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires  considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to  develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.   Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary  focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning EECC:  EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of  Enron Transportation Services.   NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to Enron entities and third parties. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the  EES Office of the Chairman.    These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth  opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our  employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

salisbury-h|Read| WSCC Reserve Standard|fyi ---------------------- Forwarded by Tim Belden/HOU/ECT on 04/03/2001 07:03 AM ---------------------------   Steve Walton 04/03/2001 07:47 AM To:	Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:	Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject:	WSCC Reserve Standard  Tim,  After receiving Dick's message regarding the changes in the WSCC Reserve Standard, I went through the documents to try to understand the change being proposed.  I also made talked with some of the people who have been participants in the development of the new standard, to check on my understanding and ask a few follow-up questions.  While on its face, the reserve requirements are being lowered the standard is actually being tightened, because the new standard deals with the locations at which reserves are covered.  In the past, a party could carry all of its spin on a single unit.  The new standard is based on governor responses to frequency excursion.  It requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to AGC to allow carrying more reserves on some machines.    As Dick indicated in his note, there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability.  For instance, carrying more reserves on NW hydro units in some hydrological conditions has the potential to reduce the Pacific Intertie rating by up to 20%.  However, given the limited reserves available in California, we are probably already in this condition.  With California at 1.5% reserve, there is a concern that the rating is already impacted.  On the other hand, when more generation comes on-line in California with new construction, then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated.    The other effect of this change is that it reduces the amount of Frequency Response Reserve (FRR) that California has to buy.  Whether the change in the responsibility to buy actually changes to pattern of reserves on machines cannot be determined at present.  However the change does have financial benefits to those who are chronically short of FRR.  Finally, I wondered how the shift to from individual control areas to a single control area with the formation of RTO West would affect the reserve requirements, since the new standard talks about carrying reserves by control area or reserve sharing pool.  I was reminded that the Northwest is a reserve sharing pool.  Since , the Northwest Power Pool and RTO West represent essentially the same portion of the system.  the RTO formation will not result in a major change in requirements.    If you have additional questions, I will dig deeper.  Steve   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

allen-p|'Sent Mail| |George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

john_forney|Inbox|New Zones|Gentlemen:  As a result of changes at ERCOT we will have to revise the Position manager and QSE MOS to incorporate the new ercot zones.  If the ESCA team can come up with an implementation plan that would be great.  Also,  we have not heard a thing about testing for daylight savings time.  Are we ready for the switch?   The ERCOT Board approved the congestion zones for next year, 2001. The ERCOT Board accepted the 3 CSC 4 CM Zone model for use in commercial congestion management for 2002.  Effective date is January 1, 2002.  The three CSC's are Graham-Parker 345 kV DCKT, Sandow-Temple 345 kV DCKT and STP-DOW 345 kV DCKT.  The four CM Zones are West02, North02, South02 and Houston02.

mcconnell-m|Sent| Re: ClickPaper.com|---------------------- Forwarded by Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 07/10/2000  09:23 AM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Greg Piper @ ENRON                           07/07/2000 06:49 PM 	  To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeffrey McMahon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Whalley  Subject: Re: ClickPaper.com     First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even  though it will be a fire drill.  We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was  just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together  by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major  categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person  responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete  timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed  to review it as well.  As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you  want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will  know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.  Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed  that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott  Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with  him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product  Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to  source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to  receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and  start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user  IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their  people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up  people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.  We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name  yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a  brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.  I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch  through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a  few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a  process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL  one and we will give it our shot this weekend.  Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We  will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan  and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive  mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will  tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use  this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a  1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier,  the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as  Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way  people can surf the content and get registered.  On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we  had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the  deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password  application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We  will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.  I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and  Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control  issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with  Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual  posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and  views.  The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all  their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete  Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to  help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July  22nd for the final testing of the system.  Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market  only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so  it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial  offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather  than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop  but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be  many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.  GP     To: Greg Piper/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: ClickPaper.com   Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon. Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?  A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.  mike           *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Mazowita and Farmer to work with plant manager (Mike Gough) to determine: How power schedules are received from Brazos and translated into fuel  requirements The plant's operating flexibility to use fuel oil over natural gas How the use of fuel oil is built into the dispatch/operation decision The degree to which the plant has historically been involved with fuel  suppliers beyond TGC (i.e., Apache, Williams, Lone Star)  Mazowita and Farmer to work with TGC (Nancy Stivers) to determine:  How gas schedules are received from the plant Why there were structural differences between the Apache/Williams fuel supply  agreements and the TGC agency agreement TGC's experience with optimizing value under the fuel supply agreements  Farmer to determine if a "form agreement" is available within ENA for  transactions of this nature  Lyons/Hill to determine (a) if there is a need to have the gas agency  agreement at the project vs. holding company level and (b) if bank approvals  are needed as a result of the new agreement  Lyons/Mazowita/Farmer to draft agency agreement  Griffith to determine the best means of handling "duel fuel" capability at  the plant within ENA  As an aside, I passed the information that Daren gave me in the meeting  concerning the tax certificate for the use of fuel oil on to Rhett Jackson,  who handled tax-related matters during the acquisition phase of this  project.    Please keep me in the loop as these contacts are made and let me know how I  can help.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

skilling-j|Sent| Re: NewPower & Enron|Wilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was  Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up!  Jeff asked me to let you know that he is very supportive of this opportunity,  and has conveyed that to Mr. Lay.  I'm not sure what next steps would be, but  please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further.  Regards, SRS     Wilson Kriegel@EES 12/15/2000 04:10 PM To: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron cc:    Subject: NewPower & Enron  Mr. Skilling, First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very  exciting news!  Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier  energy provider to Enron employees. - If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the  opportunity of this project. - As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking  forward to working with Enron (again).  I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas;  and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this  project. Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe  that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the  project.  Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay:  As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support  to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to  NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron  Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to  employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to  help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas    We have developed some compelling "Consumer Driven" sign up incentives for  Enron Employees such as "Guaranteed Savings - Free December" electricity, a  aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket  coupons.    We would appreciate your help and support on the following:  Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee  Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity.   - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to  implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group. Guidance and support for a similar "Customized" offer to Enron's partners  employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen,  Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines.    - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach.           - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or  email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the  near future.                    To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a  copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton  (Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions  with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel  as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details.     I look forward to your input and help.   This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the  national brand of "Energy Solutions".

delainey-d|Sent| Re: LIPA|Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the  Barges?  Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/02/2000  12:53 PM ---------------------------   Brian Redmond 09/29/2000 04:56 PM To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jean Mrha/NA/Enron@Enron, Ron Tapscott/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: LIPA    Dave:  Status of the 6Bs:  Enron Nigeria has sent us $7.1MM for the two turbines.   We have an agreed turbine purchase contract that we have executed and that  Enron Nigeria are supposed to execute today.  Per our discussion, Wes C.   suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1  turbine purchase revenue to Q4.  Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.  Currently, we  are:    1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the  barges by themselves 2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable  PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.  The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:  IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy,    AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability  risk (discussions ongoing)    AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for  replacement capacity charged by the desk.    AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvable  OR,  IF: We can find an "as-is, where-is" buyer for the Barges with/without the  PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG)  THEN:   ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in  Brooklyn)   ELSE:   We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.       1. LIPA:  We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason  to stop working on the deal.  2. BargeCo:  The barges will have a lower performance than what was  originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be  required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this  additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to  implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so  that we are sure this transaction is completed.       David W Delainey 09/29/2000 08:25 AM To: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jean Mrha/NA/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: LIPA  Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My  understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I  may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie)  no more 6B's or barges.

Lay (klay@enron.com)        Chairman & CEO,        Enron Corp.  Dear Mr. Lay,  Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing as a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai.  We have been given to understand  that Enron have acquired an additional space in  Kamla Mills Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building with all the facilities required for a good Call Center.  A few of these facilities being -  _ High speed (100 MBPS)  data network with switched interconnection       between offices. _ Provision  for  ISDN lines. _ 5000 line MTNL  exchange on campus _ Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government       supply. _ In addition,  a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility. _ Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.  All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt, Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000.  Inspite of that, we have once again not been considered.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at Technopolis KnowledgePark.  We are also in the process of constructing the IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can be made entirely available to you, if required.  Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located strategically at Kanjurmarg.  This too could be ideal for your requirement. We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank and can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres  across the country. We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the earliest.  Thanking you Yours sincerely, TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.

louise_kitchen|ESVL|The List?|Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.    Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.

lokay-m|Tw-commercial group| Re: TW Capacity Options|I do not see any problems with the draft tariff sheets. My concerns are how  to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with  marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define  the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:  If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate?  What are the allocation rules? How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will  monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls &  transporter call volumes? What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has  started? Will we have partial day recalls? Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring  shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release? How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have  some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate? How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee  processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in  the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee  options? Do we need a new Rate Schedule?  Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new  service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble  July 24th, 25th, & 26th.  Please let me know.  Thanks Ramona   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

chris_germany|Tennessee|Tennessee Gas Pipeline Bankruptcy Filing|Since our meeting on Tuesday, we completed additional research on the invoices from the pipeline.  I have attached a spreadsheet that provides summaries of the invoiced amounts and details of the cash out charges for gas and penalties.  Also attached is a few pages of the pipeline tariff that addresses the required process for the pipeline to collect demand/reservation fees from the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, if the Replacement Shippers, ENA and EES, do not make on-time payments.    SUMMARY  For the capacity release contracts, it appears that Tennessee  is using the bankruptcy filing to satisfy their tariff requirements of issuing non-payment notice, and termination notice due to non-payment that are required before the pipeline can bill the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, for the reservation charges that were not paid by ENA and EES.  I have not been able to find any other letters sent to Enron from Tennessee regarding non-payment.  See attached Sheet No. 337A, 338, 355, 356 and 405. The Boston Gas capacity release deal appears to be the largest $ amount of Tennessee's claim.  For November and December, $374,500.00 of the claim is associated with the reservation fees of Boston Gas' contract.  For January, $373,660.00 is the reservation fee.  The remaining portion of the bills are commodity and commodity surcharge expenses.  For the months of February and March, ENA posted a capacity release transaction on the pipeline EBB.  Each month, the deal was posted at 100% maximum rate transaction with Boston Gas as the pre-arranged party.  Therefore there should not be a continuing for those months.  At Boston Gas' request, both postings specified that the releases were subject to bid.   Tennessee's listing of contracts in the bankruptcy filing excludes the five contracts designated as "ENA Agent-Nomination and Billing".  This makes sense in that ENA was just a middle-man and transportation charges were being passed through to the customer.  Tennessee must be billing the customers directly! For the Cash Out and Level Charges (i.e. penalties), there are two summaries that describe the information that you requested.  I believe that it is important to distinguish between current and prior month.  Current month imbalance numbers are usually tracked by the pipeline and are available to shippers with a couple of day lag time.  Prior month imbalances are made by the pipeline when accounting problems and issues result in reallocations of shipper volumes.  For example, in the Dec 2001 invoice dated 1/14/2002 for ENA's K# 80045, current month imbalance was 34,266 Dth due the pipeline or $92,323.29.  Since gas was due the pipeline, a Level Charge or $38,997.33 was also due the pipeline.  Prior month cash outs of 134,869 Dth or $887,821.20 due ENA also appeared in the same bill.  This adjustment covered the months of Oct 2000 through April 2001.  Another prior period adjustment will probably be made by the pipeline for May 2001 through December 2001 time period.  Please note that the Average $/Unit price is a simple average and not what is shown as the cash out gas price on the invoice. For ENA, the storage agreement was used post-petition so that the storage inventory could be withdrawn.  It is my understanding that ENA has not paid the invoices yet.  There may be an issue whether or not the discounted rate was in effect for the last month that withdrawals took place.  ENA is waiting to see what the billed rate is before a payment is made to the pipeline. EES's LMSMA balancing agreement is tied to serving one of EES's former customers.  The pipeline has expressed an interest in retroactively transferring this agreement and obligations over to the new supplier.  We are still trying to get additional information on the timing from EES. As you can tell from the summary, there is some miscellaneous charges that have popped up.  One is clearly designated as a Late Payment Charge.  The others could probably fall into a similar category.   We have tried to summarize the facts.  I will leave it up to you to decide whether the amounts are prepetition or post petition.

I think that  I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me  know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  Enron.  Regards, Tim  New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a  new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the  following heat rate table:   Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap   <25 GW   10,775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90   >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead  system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery.  FERC Context FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000. The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices. The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires) FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know  what they will find or what they will propose. The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will  likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on  11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments. Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations. It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into  effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC  extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.  Impact of Price Caps The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below. Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.    Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new  price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices. Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets. Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January  through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January  through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400  from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations. We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour  could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value! The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000  NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.         *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

kenneth_lay|Discussion threads|Transactions in Lilly Stock|This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions, including:  -   purchases -   sales -   gifts -   trust or partnership transactions -   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan -   exchange fund transactions  We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two reasons:     There are certain times when you should not engage in market    transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around    the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are    announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside    information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our    reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.    While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to    you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have    legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.  2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.  If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any proposed transaction.  If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate to call me.

dasovich-j|Natural gas strategy| New PG&E Schedule G-CFS|Jeff,   I wanted to call attention to one of the new PG&E rate schedules (G-CFS)  which Randy Litteneker distributed on Friday evening.   The Assigned Storage Monthly Charge under G-CFS indicates the charge will  become retroactively effective January 2000. How can PG&E implement a back  charge of this nature? I believe these charges under this rate schedule  should not commence until April 2000. The basis for my argument is as  follows....  Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that "In any storage year under this rate  schedule, a CTA will be allowed one annual cycle for injection, inventory and  withdrawal of gas in storage." While the typical storage year remains in  effect, the charges would start in mid storage season when operational and  economic decisions have already been completed.  Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that "Prior to March 1, each CTA will be  given the option to reject a percentage of its initial Storage Allocation, up  to 100 percent (%), for the upcoming storage year of April 1 through March 31  (Storage Year)". This option was not given for the current storage year April  2000 - March 2001. Further evidence in the current Schedule G-CT states that  "PG&E will allocate to the CTA, acting on behalf of Customers in the Group, a  pro rate share of of PG&E's total core storage capacity reservations." The  current schedule makes no indication of ability to reject any allocated  portion.  I apologize for continuing to harp on this issue but as stated in proposed  G-CFS, I would incur charges of $506,700 (this is different from the $420,000  I mentioned on the phone because I neglected to include the capacity we will  receive from the PG&E Eneryg Services acquisition. This charge would  obliterate the Gas Desk goals for 2000.   Please call me to discuss when you have a chance. Thanks.

kitchen-l|ESVL| Ardmore facilities| As a follow up to our meeting last week with Colleen on the Ardmore facility, I had a conversation this morningwith Richard Sanders concerning the status of the settlement negotiations with Dynegy concerning Northern Natural Gas. I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a data center.   I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NETCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center. 	The lease also needs to make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron's control.  Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enron developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as AEP, Bridgeline and Northern Natural Gas.	If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.							  Anne C.

gerald_nemec|All documents|Sale of Power Barges to Enron North America Corp.|Barbara,  Attached is the Memorandum Of Agreement referenced in my voicemail to you of  10:15 a.m. today.  The Turbine sale is to be documented by an Asset Purchase  Agreement attached as Exhibit E--it is very vanilla from a Seller's  perspective and should be easy to negotiate into final form.  As mentioned in my voicemail, the only legal issue I have with the Barge Sale  portion of the document is Section 12 (b), the Indemnification Clause which  does not indemnify ENA for third party claims arising out of BargeCo's breach  of the contract.  A reasonable compromise, in my opinion, would be to require  Bargeco to indemnify us against third party claims for which there is no  specifically identified remedy (such as delay damages or MW buydown damages)  in the Memorandum of Agreement.  This would take care of most LIPA risks.  Aside from the foregoing, I'm happy with the document.  Now Ron and Curly  Baca have to come to terms on (i) the 90/10 Price payment timing; (ii) the  $1,000,000 in spares that Ron thought he was buying and (iii) whether the is  a purchase price adjustment if the barges test out at less than 66 MW of  capacity.

kitchen-l|Restructuring| RE: Investments Meeting Agenda|Does ECR realize the negatives coming in MEGS.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Kitchen, Louise   Sent:	Thursday, June 21, 2001 4:55 PM To:	Garland, Kevin Cc:	Lavorato, John; Colwell, Wes; Miller, Michael L. Subject:	Re: Investments Meeting Agenda  I had a meeting this morning with Dick to go through the assets following a discussions with the Enron Americas team.  Enron Americas will be keeping the following assets:  Bridgeline - Mrha LRC (Enron I Cavern - to Bridgeline) - Mrha MEGS - this asset has been transferred to ECR within Enron Americas Onondaga - to be retained by Ben Jacoby  This solves one of the issues below.  Louise     From:	Kevin Garland/ENRON@enronXgate on 06/21/2001 03:54 PM To:	John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate, Wes Colwell/ENRON@enronXgate, Michael L Miller/ENRON@enronXgate cc:	Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject:	Investments Meeting Agenda  John, Wes and Michael,  The purpose of tomorrow's meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group.  The specific issues are as follows:  ·	Encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $3 million to $9.85 million in Q4 2000 without justification.  It should be written back down at the end of this quarter.  Otherwise, we are going to have a bigger problem later. ·	Dais Analytic - same issue as above.  Investment was written up from $8 million to $20 million.  It should be written back down this quarter. ·	AMPS - This is a problem.  This company is going to continue to need capital (an additional $7 million immediately) well beyond what Enron should be funding.  I am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation.  If it is that important to the strategic effort of ENA, then I recommend that ENA continue to manage the company and provide financing. ·	Bridgeline - After further evaluation, it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group.  I spoke with Jeff Donahue, and we both agree that if you want it sold, then his team should be the right one to do it. ·	Copel - This one is fuzzy, but Jeff Donahue and I have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment.  We still need to figure this one out.  KG    *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

michelle_cash|Notes inbox|Re: Project Canary - Asset Purchase Agreement|Michelle, I reviewed the Project Canary Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and offer the following observations:  In an asset transaction, where the buyer did not want to acquire or assume the employee benefit plans of the seller, I have always recommended to include such plans and liabilities in the statement of excluded assets. Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of the Agreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans are not excluded.  Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an asset transaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding, compliance and administration of the plans.  These kinds of representations are not in the Agreement.  The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel and actuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respect to these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can be inserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.  You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel and actuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.

shackleton-s|Sent| Re: Swap Agreement|FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT on 07/23/99 09:38  AM ---------------------------     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	From:  "John Novak" <John_Novak@ei.enron.com>                            07/23/99 12:05 AM 	  To: "Lefler, Dean" <dlefler@velaw.com> cc: dblack@ei.enron.com, "Kent Castleman" <Kent_Castleman@ei.enron.com>,  "Stephen H Friedlander" <Stephen_H_Friedlander@ei.enron.com>, "Beth Rosen"  <Beth_Rosen@ei.enron.com>, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT, "Barquin, John"  <jbarquin@velaw.com>, "Nasim H Khan" <Nasim_H_Khan@ei.enron.com>  Subject: Re: Swap Agreement      We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from  the differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and, subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be distributed to E & S. Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.   Thanks.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know so that we can stop this process.  Comments on the Draft Schedule:       1.  Part 1(a) "Specified Entity":  A Specified Entity is an entity other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a Specified Entity with respect to TBS.       2.  Part 1(b) "Threshold Amount": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.       3.  Part 1(h) "Additional Event of Default":  If we use a swap arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest in TBS could result in termination?       4.  Part 2  "Representations":  I think that we need someone in tax to determine whether TBS can make the representations.       5.  Part 4(d) & (e) "Credit Support Provider": Shell will be the credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.       6.  Part 4(g) "Governing Law", 4(h) "Arbitration": The schedule proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami, under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).  Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:       I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas Supply Agreement under the "Fixed Amount Details" but have not done so under the "Floating Amount Details", which cross-references the provisions of the SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.       Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to completion.

bass-e|Discussion threads| Inside UT Football: November 30, 2000|  [IMAGE]  	  [IMAGE]    	 	 	[IMAGE] 	 	 	Uniform discussion among UT fans  	  	Nov. 30, 2000  	  	 	[IMAGE]Chip Brown, who covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News,  answers your questions about the bowl picture, UT's quarterback situation,  Chris Simms, next year's potential stars and more. Inside UT Football appears  on Thursdays.  	 	  	E-mail questions to Chip: chipbrown@dallasnews.com  	 	 	  	Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns  	on DallasNews.com's Colleges site  	 	 	 	Chip Shot  	  	 	I received several responses to an e-mail from a reader last week regarding  UT's uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them. Here are some of  the responses ...  	 	   	 	One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their   uniforms. I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the  classiest,  coolest uniforms in the country! I admit to being biased, but  love the  simple, non-busy look of the all-white uniforms. I also have no  problem with  the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested. The  white helmets  with the simple, yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as  pronounced as  the "star" on the Dallas Cowboys' helmet. While I agree with him about the  black shoes, I think any changes to "individualize" or  otherwise change  their "look" would be a move in the wrong direction. - Rick Peurifoy  	 	 I was interested in John Pharr's comments about the UT uniforms. Having been  at UT in the 1960s, I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go. I  certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenced  by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans  individual name on back and "TEXAS" on the front), with the plain white pants  and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but  the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the  "candy-striped" pants (ala OU) and added the "TEXAS" to the jersey.  Personally I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings  would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One  amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the  uniforms; his response was that these are "work clothes" and not intended to  be fancy. I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes back  a long way. I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the  Longhorn in the early 1960s, but it didn't add much. Keep up the good work. I  always enjoy your newsletter. - Tom Thornell  	 	 Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are among  the sharpest anywhere. If we change the helmets, then we look like a high  school team. What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are  orange and white. Period. So what if it doesn't have too much color? I hope  we stay exactly the same. Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms and  added orange pants? They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field. -  Russell Phillips  	 	 	 	  	Longhorn Q & A  	 Q: Can you give us a look at the bowl picture?  	 ˜˜ Sandy Martin  	 	 BROWN:  Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday and  will face either Oregon State or Oregon. It will be Oregon State if the  Beavers don't get a BCS berth. It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BCS  berth. If OU beats Kansas State, look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton  Bowl. Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl; Iowa State would go to the  Insight.com Bowl; Texas Aúwould go to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport and  play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State; and Texas Tech would  go to the galleryfurniture.com Bowl.   	˜ 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[IMAGE]  	Chris Simms   	 	Q: I'm very happy for Chris Simms, but what should we expect from him now? It  seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt, although one could argue  that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year. Still,  since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yanked  after five passes, a redshirt seems like a reach. If he doesn't redshirt,  what is  	 	the best guess for Texas QB in 2001? I know that you get asked this every  week, but with the new development following the Aúgame, it seems that we are  starting fresh in this story.  	˜˜ Kyle Moore  	 	 BROWN:  Simms' big-time performance against Aúadds all kinds of new wrinkles  to the landscape for 2001. My best guess is Simms will get the start for the  bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this  season. Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again  gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into the  spring and next fall. Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a  rotation again. But one would have to think after the sluggish start the  offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be  reluctant to do that again. Despite breaking nearly every passing record at  Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his last  outings before getting injured. Simms would seem to have everything going his  way. The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlier  this season. Now that they've seen it, you would have to think that they want  to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next two  years (not stick with a guy who only has one season left). I'm not saying  that's fair. But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would  think. But we won't know how the QB situation for 2001 will shake out until  next fall, most likely.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning, UT could  have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full. Do you  think B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on?  Did they just blossom during the Aúgame? Otherwise, why haven't they seen the  field more?  	˜˜ A.B.  	 	 BROWN:  Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, but you  could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year  with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will have  back at those positions. There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that the  fullback position was pretty average this season. So the coaches will take a  strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB. At 6-3 and 235, he has the  size. He is also quick with good hands. If Matthews doesn't add significant  oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more  one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field. But we'll see. UT coaches  did a nice job of adjusting this season to a two-back, two-receiver set after  they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers (with too many  formations and too many quarterbacks). Now that the receivers can probably  handle more of the playbook, look for UT to be as multiple and complex an  offense as possible next season. B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team's  second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty. Sloan Thomas was the one  who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions  and be ready to fill in at any of them. So he was slowed by the learning  process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and  Brandon Healy. Healy is a senior, so he'll be gone next year. Flowers should  be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are  either redshirting or transferred?  	˜˜ Bart Fields  	 	 BROWN:  Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the  sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer  Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan). Simms said  both will really help the team a lot next year. Jeffery is 6-2 and trying to  bulk up from 170 pounds. Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170  pounds. But both have shown great hands in practice. The first two names that  jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl  practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and  Rashad Thomas. With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'Andre  Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new  faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at  linebacker in two years.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: I'm a little concerned about our running backs. Next year's crop looks  mighty inexperienced. We never seemed to be able to run up the middle  consistently this year. Who would you figure has the best shot at being an  inside bruiser? What role will our fullbacks play?   	˜˜ Russell Phillips  	 	 BROWN:  It's the biggest question mark on an offense that should be  absolutely loaded next season. I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis  and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take over  at tackle nicely. Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Garr  has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good. So with a line  that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run  behind it. Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges  Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility. Coaches want Victor Ike, Kenny  Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up. Coaches have told those  three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next  year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce  consistently.  	˜ 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[IMAGE]  	Sloan Thomas   	 	Q: With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has, is there enough room at wideout  for Artie Ellis next season?  	 ˜˜ Frank Seles  	 	 BROWN:  Don't be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season. At  6-3 and more than 200 pounds, he is a bit undersized but could add the  weight. His speed would give Texas the sure-handed, deep-threat tight end  they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife. It may be a longshot, but don't  be surprised.  	 	˜ 	 	 	 Q: While watching the A&M-UT game, I noticed that UT received the ball at  the opening kickoff and the second-half kickoff. And UT got the wind at its  back in the 4th quarter. How did this happen, and if Aúwon the toss, why  would the Aggies choose to defer, give UT the ball at both kickoffs, and go  into the wind in the 2nd and 4th quarters?  	˜˜ Ryan M., Austin  	 	 BROWN:  Texas Aúwon the toss at the beginning of the game and chose the wind  at its back, giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter. The  Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter  and took the ball into the wind.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team coach.  UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams. This  year the Longhorns would have been 10-1 and possibly on their way to a BCS  game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown  against Stanford. With money apparently not being a factor, I really do not  understand why Brown doesn't break down and hire some specialized help.   	 ˜˜ Don Stevenson, Huntington, Texas  	 	 BROWN:  I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan, which is to  divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches.  	˜ 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[IMAGE]  	De'Andre Lewis making the tackle   	 	Q: Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is for a  winning team. We've had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer and  James Brown whose on-field performances may have been surpassed by their  off-field contributions. I think we're losing a lot of leadership this year  when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave. Of the returning players, who  does it look like will step up as team leaders next year?  	˜˜ Keith Heugatter  	 	 	 BROWN:  On defense, Mack Brown said he'll look for Cory Redding and De'Andre  Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers and  Greg Brown. On offense, UT will look to its quarterback, its young receivers  and linemen such as Antwan Kirk-Hughes of Waxahachie for leadership.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season?  	˜˜ Steve Beauchamp  	 	 BROWN:  The obvious ones are Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers, Greg Brown, Hodges  Mitchell and Leonard Davis. But the one that may be missed the most is Kris  Stockton. He kicked several game-winning field goals two years ago and has  done nothing but continue to break records since. He has been an afterthought  because he has been so automatic on field goals. He has also done an  excellent job of punting this season. Matt McFadden, a redshirt freshman,  will handle the kicking duties next year. And at punter, redshirt freshman  Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed to  the Longhorns for next year. That will be a huge question mark for Texas to  answer next season.  	˜ 	 	 Q: Who do you pick in the Kansas State-OU game? Seems like OU is missing its  October magic. I'd have to take OU in a close one, 28-24. Heupel isn't great,  but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offense  in the pros.  	˜˜ Andrew Bowen  	 	 BROWN:  I, too, think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue its  Shock the World season. Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce  some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman. The votes  are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum.  	˜ 	 	 	 Q: Can you give us an update on the men's and women's basketball teams?  	˜˜ Lucius Thornton  	 	 BROWN:  The men's team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victories  over Navy, California and Indiana - any of which could help the Longhorns  down the road at tournament time. The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to  Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT, but coach Rick Barnes was able  to prove a point to his team about being intimidated. As of Tuesday night's  game with UT-San Antonio, Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup -  point guard Royal Ivey, small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thomas.  Duncanville's Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward. Chris  Owens has been a shot-blocking force, and transfer Maurice Evans is the  team's leading scorer, and is starting to hit a better percentage from the  floor. The men's team doesn't have another test until Dec. 9, when the team  plays at South Florida. Other games worth watching or getting tickets for  include home games against Illinois (Dec. 23) and Utah (Dec. 30). The women's  team has also gotten off to a nice start, with its only early-season loss  coming against Purdue. The women's team is relying on several newcomers,  including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings. The team is  also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard. So both teams are young with a  lot of upside.

louise_kitchen|Netco Legal|RE: GTCs, Forms and Agreements|If there any drafts available before 3:00pm I would very much approciate it if you could e-mail them to me so I can read them on the flight. (Blacklines would be GREAT!). Otherswise if you could please send the drafts to the St Regis.  Best regards,  Bryan  -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Haedicke Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2002 7:20 PM To: Mark.Taylor; Elizabeth.Sager; Jeffrey.T.Hodge; Carol.St.Clair; Mary.Cook; William.S.Bradford; Peter.Keohane; James.D.Steffes; David.Forster; Christopher.F.Calger; Rob.Milnthorp; Louise.Kitchen; Steve.C.Hall; Christian.Yoder Cc: Mark.Haedicke; Murtagh, Bryan Subject: GTCs, Forms and Agreements   The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by the end of business on Friday.  To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev [Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB 38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday.  This timing is important in the overall rollout plan.  Peter Keohane is also coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the Canadian forms.  Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues.  On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday.  On the power side, ERCOT issues should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission agreements etc. can wait until next week.  Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated goal.

Tech expert  Michael Murphy reveals their names--and the best strategy  for buying them today--in his JUST-RELEASED FREE REPORT:  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=147834   "Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does." -- Jane Austen   SMITHKLINE TO BUY BLOCK DRUG The big British drug maker bolsters its consumer business.  By Tom Jacobs  British-based drug producer SmithKline Beecham (NYSE: SBH) announced today that it would swallow New Jersey's oral products maker Block Drug (Nasdaq: BLOCA) for $1.24 billion. SmithKline will pay $53 a share for Block, which closed Friday at $50.63, up 0.75%. SmithKline ended the week at $67.44, a mere 5% under its 52-week high.  SmithKline is expanding its consumer business while competitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are shedding theirs to focus on drugs. SmithKline already earns one-third of its revenues from consumer products, which include Aquafresh toothpaste, and now adds Block's Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaner brands. Commentators speculate that SmithKline is keeping a consumer division to better deliver non-prescription versions of its own drugs that have lost patent protection, or that the Block buyout better positions SmithKline to spin off its consumer division.  At the same time, the British drug powerhouse is pushing into genomics: It has joined a new public-private consortium to fund efforts to decode mouse DNA within the next six months. The $53 million Mouse Sequencing Consortium includes SmithKline, Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX), the Merck Genome Research Institute, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the British-based Wellcome Trust. Like its sibling the SNP Consortium, the Mouse confab hopes to speed genomic data into the public domain. Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and other companies are competing to sequence the mouse genome and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to sell in proprietary databases. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147835  Surrounding these events is the pending merger of SmithKline with larger drug maker Glaxo Wellcome (NYSE: GLX). The two await regulatory approval to create the world's second-largest pharmaceutical firm with a $180 billion market cap. Perhaps because of their experience -- the Federal Trade Commission has delayed the merger twice and now won't rule until the end of the year -- SmithKline hasn't announced a target date to close the Block deal. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Reuters reports that General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Fiat are joining forces for talks to purchase some or all of ailing South Korean car maker Daewoo. Daewoo Motor is one of 12 units of Daewoo Group, which creditors rescued in August and seek to shore up. Ford beat out GM in June for exclusive talks with Daewoo, but Ford ended negotiations in September. GM and Daewoo Motors have been around the block before -- several times. Their 15-year alliance ended in 1992.  City delivery speedsters Kozmo.com and Urbanfetch.com are talking a Kozmo buyout again, according to The New York Times. Kozmo has not been the most ardent suitor: It sued Urbanfetch before it opened last year and settled out of court. The parties have bailed from previous talks at the last minute. The Times' sources state that the new company would hope to go public in the next year -- if the Internet IPO market turns up.  Facing tomorrow's announcement of latest quarter earnings, biotech drug maker Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) licensed five new drug targets from genomics drug discovery company CuraGen (Nasdaq: CRGN). Biogen has been criticized for the weakness of its drug development pipeline, and the CuraGen deal gives Biogen a jump start at the early stages of the pipeline -- five targets against which to test possible drug candidates. Biogen also announced a management realignment Friday.  A new gene bank, the First Genetic Trust, will open to allay people's reluctance to share their genetic data with researchers. Arthur Holden, chair of the SNP Consortium and Mouse Consortium (see lead story above), will form the bank with David Wang, former head of genomics and bioinformatics at Motorola (NYSE: MOT), and Andrea Califano, former computational biology director at IBM (NYSE: IBM). The bank would perform two main functions designed to keep individual information private, assuage fears that information could be used to deny employment or insurance, and increase efficiency. The bank would provide analysis results to researchers, but not the individual genetic data, and patients could authorize the bank to give their doctors access to a patient's DNA account for prescription purposes instead of having to test patients each time. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147836  Enjoy Friday's Foolish market wrap-up with one swift click! http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147837 _________________________________________________________________  EDITOR'S PICK  Your favorite stock takes a nosedive and you want to sell it, take a tax loss, and buy it back at the lower price.

ward-k|All documents| Re: Nominations for February|John:  Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It  might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day  to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a  flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant  amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.

lynn_blair|Sent Items|FW: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc|    FYI.  Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Davis, Britt  Sent: Friday, September 21, 2001 11:19 AM To: Craig, Rick; Cessac, Kenneth; Kile, Rick; Thompson, Charlie; Hawkins, Don; Mendez, Angela; Dietz, Rick; Blair, Lynn; Woodson, Harry; Anderson, Gary E.; Dykes, Tangie Cc: Fossum, Drew; Porter, Gregory J.; Ringblom, Kathy; Zikes, Becky; 'gharvey@gibbs-bruns.com' Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc   Everyone:   Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:   1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.   2.  We are missing an "an" in the first sentence, right before the word "incident"; that will be corrected.   3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.   4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.   5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?    6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.   Many thanks.   Britt     -----Original Message----- From: Anna L.

jeffrey_a_shankman|Sent Items|RE: Total DA Load at 5.7% as of 8/31|Here's what I'll do.  I'll go back and look at the materials they sent us.  Maybe you could do the same, so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our "contribution" is.  Best, Jeff   -----Original Message----- From: 	Curry, Wanda   Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 6:26 PM To:	Dasovich, Jeff Subject:	RE: Total DA Load at 5.7% as of 8/31  Yeah.  Guess we do have to worry about that.   I was thinking it would apply to our receivable, not the total under collection, but that would not make sense.  Maybe the other idea will work.  It gets difficult to continue to think of ways around some of these problems.  Thanks, Wanda   -----Original Message----- From: 	Dasovich, Jeff   Sent:	Tuesday, October  23, 2001 6:16 PM To:	Curry, Wanda Subject:	RE: Total DA Load at 5.7% as of 8/31  Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Curry, Wanda   Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 5:58 PM To:	Dasovich, Jeff Subject:	FW: Total DA Load at 5.7% as of 8/31   What do you think about the % of load argument?

elizabeth_sager|All documents|FYI - Kaiser One Month Melodrama|---------------------- Forwarded by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 03/22/2000  12:49 PM ---------------------------  Christian Yoder  03/22/2000 12:16 PM To: Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris  Hilgert/HOU/ECT@ect, Christopher Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Kaiser One Month Melodrama  A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same  time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the  matter at this point I offer the following:  Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH. Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm  before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley. West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power  guys in Spokane are saying that we can "sleeve"  the power to them through  Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached   and assume nothing about who they resell it too.  Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be  detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this  quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the  one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following  this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please  give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

watson-k|Italy| RE: Question about rooms|Sounds like the pizza eating contest is on.  John, Last weekend I tried to say my poor Italian was "driving my professor to drink"  Guiardo mi professoro a bevere or something like that.  Just like "quick bite" got Kim a funny look in Greece, "flip a coin" may or may not be known in Italy.  We get in trouble almost every class either using a literal translation or slang.

One confirming question:  do you have TWO of the standard double rooms, instead of one standard and one superior, for the same dates?

shackleton-s|Notes inbox| SCEM ISDA Date|Hi Sara,   I have a question pertaining to Counterparty - Southern Company Energy  Marketing, L.P.  We have been receiving Executed Financial Confirmation  Letters with our ISDA Master Agreement Date June 1, 1994 striked through and  SCEM writes in June 28, 1994 (execution date).  I have been researching with  Rhonda Denton and we state June 1, 1994 as the effective date, the date that  is on the Master Agreement.  SCEM wants June 28, 1994 date - when the Master  Agreement was executed.  I have spoken to Jeff at SCEM and he said it was  "industry standard" to use the execution date.    Our confirm states "This  Confirmation supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master  Agreement dated as June 1, 1994, as amended....   Is EPMI's Date correct or  are both dates valid.   Please let me know if you need any further  information.   Thank you  Stephanie  Enron Power Marketing, Inc x39210  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

john_arnold|All documents| |Dave: I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this  power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC  in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a  mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them  with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a  way to generate false P&L?

ybarbo-p|ProCaribe| RE: Technical limitations with Eco LPG|Miguel,   Contractually: On the positive side, Section 7.3.1.1 says that "EcoElectrica and Terminal Operator shall use reasonable efforts to integrate Terminal Operator's then committed LPG purchases and supply arrangements into EcoElectrica's overall LPG purchase and supply program". However, Eco's borrowing rights under Section 7.3.2.4 could give ProCaribe its biggest problem. Eco can drawdown ProCaribe's inventories to 3250 MT as long as there is a vessel loading or en route with at least 8,000 MT of LPG for EcoElectrica. If the cargo takes 14 days to arrive, ProCaribe's needs would be 6,300 MT during those 14 days. We need to have a provision in our deal with PDVSA that gives ProCaribe the option to receive 4,000 - 5,000 MT on short notice if Eco declares a Second Period Supply Disruption.   Mechanically: I cannot think of any reasons why ProCaribe would be unable to supply both EcoElectrica and all of Puerto Rico's LPG distributors. The difference between what we are hoping for under the PDVSA agreement and what ProCaribe was doing last year is the loading of an additional 175,000 gallons (335 MT) per day into trucks. That would be an additional 16 trucks per day. If EcoElectrica was at 100% output, they would be consuming 1900 MT per day and the rest of the island would be using 450 MT per day. As long as your heaters can warm-up a total of 2500 MT per day, you should be in the clear.   Inventory Requirements: EcoElectrica, today, is at risk if there is an extended disruption in its LNG supply. That risk will be there, regardless of whether or not ProCaribe does the PDVSA deal. Eco must keep a minimum supply of 15 days of fuel on site. Typically, an LNG ship arrives when there is 6 days of LNG in the tank. That means that Eco must have 9 days of LPG and/or diesel. As of August 31st, Eco had 5 days of LPG (9250 MT) and 4 days of diesel (2,800,000 gallons) on-site. If Eco were suddenly faced with a disruption in LNG supply, Eco would call PDVSA for LPG and both Coastal and Amerada Hess for diesel. Depending on availability, purchases would be made from those 3 suppliers to relieve the crisis. In the past, it has been much easier to arrange a short-notice diesel purchase than an LPG purchase. If necessary, a larger LPG purchase could be arranged from Africa or the North Sea. Expect an advance notice of at least 35 days. Again, Eco has this risk even under today's operations.   Logistics: I do not see the PDVSA deal as a negative factor from the logistics point of view. PDVSA asks for fewer days of advance notice and seems to be more flexible. If Eco were in a position of having to bring in large cargoes of LPG from across the Atlantic, the PDVSA deal may actually make the logistics easier if PDVSA would be flexible in their deliveries.   Paul       -----Original Message----- From: Mahan, Mariella  Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 7:22 PM To: Maltes, Miguel; Y'Barbo, Paul Subject: Technical limitations with Eco LPG   Are there ANY technical limitations imposed by a potential sudden need to use LPG at Eco that would get in the way of performance under the proposed PDVSA agreement?  What are the conditions that Eco would have to face for Procaribe to experience storage or receiving constraints resulting from having to meet both Eco's and PDVSA's needs?

kenneth_lay|Notes inbox|India "CPIL" Supreme Court Case|The Supreme Court hearing for the case in India regarding the alleged  improper bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our  legal team's opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding  progressed and also on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding  arguments of the case today in India.   The panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months to write their  opinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably shouldn't   speculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important  points:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to  Enron/Reliance/ONGC will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges  will request the PSC to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and  generally accepted by the panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According  to my general counsel, Stephen Wallace, the only concern our team has is that  the judges were quite critical of the CBI (the government group that  investigated Reliance for wrong doing in the bid process) during that portion  of the testimony and there is a possibility that they could request an  additional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood of the judges  ordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside to such a  decision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on Reliance,  not Enron.   Enron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal front and our team,  as expected, carried the load for this case even though we were not the  primary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the CPIL  assertions because the others were not prepared and then later "coached" the  others to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive  case than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very  fortunate to be extremely well prepared and well represented.     Based on the above information,  I do not think this issue "CPIL lawsuit"   should  impact any future decisions we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti  assets.  This outcome basically eliminates one of the two issues impeding the  progress of  the  project I showed Joe, our proposal to sell  Panna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe we have a unique  opportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through an  arrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow  us to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash  flow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the  step-up last year) for the company.   The only remaining hurdle is a tax  issue that we are currently working.   jeff  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

beck-s|Notes inbox| Debt Trading Losses|We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not  being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in  approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :    The primary control issues are: £ Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements £ Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes £ Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had  not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)  The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by  Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will  implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust  approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

lokay-m|All documents| A Couple of Transportation Notes on El Paso and Nova|El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that  will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit  scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system  integrity.   Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to  maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its  imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant  shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance  in effect.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

craig_dean|Sent Items| |Amy,  Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.

horton-s|All documents| Business Review|After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE  business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand  better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial  exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy  to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast  of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.  Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and  subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

dan_hyvl|Sent|Re: FW: Enfolio Contract with CPS|Christian,  I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract  document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the  Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice  that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have  to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have  not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order  Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company  containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no  number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions.

Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)  "and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality obligation."  2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices  Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number _________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725. Thanks ...      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

larry_campbell|Discussion threads|RE: Review Draft - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report|Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which  we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of  I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on  the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east  side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking  into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed  construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the  potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal  with them.

haedicke-m|All documents| Chinese Wall Resource Group| You have been designated as a member of the &Resource Group8 for purposes of  the Enron Wholesale Services (&EWS8) Chinese Wall policy, which is currently  being revised to reflect the new EWS organizational structure.   The Chinese Wall policy serves to reduce the risk of insider trading  liability by keeping material non-public information &walled off8 from our  equity trading personnel.  The Resource Group acts as a sort of &filter8 so  that certain information may pass through the "wall", under appropriate  controls.  It is critical that we enforce proper compliance with the Chinese  Wall policy.  Without this policy, Enron would not be able to engage in  equity trading activities.   Early next year, the ENA Legal Department will conduct training sessions on  Chinese Wall policies and procedures for our equity traders, Resource Group  members, and other appropriate employees.  A larger group of employees will  receive the newly revised policies and procedures and be asked to certify  compliance.  In the meantime, please feel free to call Lance Schuler at  35419, Bob Bruce at 57780, or me at 36544 should you have any questions  concerning the policy or the role of the Resource Group.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

beck-s|EOL| RE: EOL Average Deal Count as of 3-14-01|Special note on this week's report.   The Weekly Average Deal Count Report is now available for download at the EOL  Intranet Site located at http//:eolinfo.enron.com.  To access the latest Average Deal Count Report, simply follow the link above.  Once on the Intranet site, select "Reports", then go into the "Secured  Reports" section and choose the "Regional Analysis" report from the dropdown  list. Enter your regular Windows login ID and password when prompted and the  report will load automatically.  We welcome your feedback, so if you have any questions or comments regarding  the new Intranet site and the reports posted there, please contact Peter  Berzins at x57597 or Bryan Deluca at x36161.   Thank you,  Torrey Moorer Manager, EOL Product Control Group Reporting 	 	   Notes for this Week's Report:  *  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count  steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a  day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date  high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.  *  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main  reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has  increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since  January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its  overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to  1,018 deals per day.  *  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal  Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day  in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average  daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.   The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.  *  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has  decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from  359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count  has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.   The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.  *  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on  EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.   Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in  February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.  *  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450  trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month  of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This  represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL  volumes have decreased similarly as well.  *  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a  daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents  about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.  --------------- The following files contain a graphical view of the average deal count and  volumes per month by Commodity for EOL and OTC transactions since the launch  of EnronOnline.

larry_campbell|Discussion threads|EPA Rules; Glycol Dehys|The oil and gas production (O&G) and transmission and storage (T&S) MACT  rules have been signed by EPA and should appear in the Federal Register very  soon (late May or early June). You will have three years to comply for  existing sources, but new sources must comply with these regulations as soon  as the rules appear in the Federal Register. New sources, as defined in the  regulations, are any dehys that were installed on or after February 6, 1998.  I will be putting out an Environmental Notice about these rules, but if you  have a dehy that was installed on or after February 6, 1998, contact me and  we can discuss how to get that unit into compliance immediately. In addition  to control requirements, you will have 120 days to notify EPA about any new  sources.

fossum-d|'sent mail| Confidentiality Regarding Acquisitions|I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of  activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.  John  Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking  at a number of potential deals.  While these deal evaluation projects have  become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are  extremely confidential.  Even after a potential seller has announced that it  is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well  as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential.    I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees  of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the  future.  If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at  the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or  assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not  permitted to discuss potential acquisitions.  Please be aware that the  confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition  evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees  of the target company.    If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do  not hesitate to give me a call.  Thank you for your assistance.

Steven J Ehrig@ENRON 	06/22/2000 05:51 PM 		 		 To: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Request for Risk Control Audit  Tana,  I am currently working on an audit of the Risk Controls Group sanctioned by  Enron North America. As a part of this audit, one of my objectives is to become more familiar with  the NYMEX Limits set for traders.  Specifically I want to:  1.   Ensure that the limits are correct  2.  See appropriate action was taken to satisfy the request of the Trader   (ie.  If a request was made today to raise the limits, approval from the  NYMEX    should be obtained. and 3. I'd like to see all the documentation taking place between  trader-Legal-Nymex.   -- Does legal call NYMEX, or e-mail them? Please indicate the specific  documentation involved.  I realize that this is a bit vague, but I just wanted to give a heads up on  what my basic objectives were. I was hoping that you could point me in the right direction, or perhaps let  me know someone in your group from whom I can get further information.  I certainly appreciate all of your help. If you have any questions I can be reached at x31684.    Sincerely,  Jack Ehrig   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

steffes-j|California Issues - PNW Refunds| RE: PNW case|I agree - wrong connotation - I meant that it is the closest thing to actually filing testimony.  I also agree that it is preferable.   -----Original Message----- From: 	"Dan Watkiss" <dwatkiss@bracepatt.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Dan+20Watkiss+22+20+3Cdwatkiss+40bracepatt+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent:	Wednesday, August 22, 2001 3:44 PM To:	gfergus@brobeck.com; Steffes, James D.; Frank, Robert Subject:	Re: PNW case  Bob, I disagree that Alternative 2 is the "next best thing" to filing testimony on ripple.  Alternative 2 is the best approach because (as we are pursuing it) we preserve all of our rights and, at the same time, preserve the possibility that this case will go nowhere.  Jeffrey D.

Here's my take:  Alternative 1 - File "ripple" refund claim Advantages: (1) testimony goes in record and is available for briefing/argument;(2)procedural risks are minimized. Disadvantages:  (1) implicitly undermines primary position that refunds are unjustified; (2)witnesses are available for cross-examination; (3) ALJ may reject depending on ruling on proposed order.  Alternative 2 - File "offer of proof" showing ripple claims Advantages: (1)next best thing to testimony; (2) keeps burden and focus on initial claimants', (3) only marginally compromises procedural position if ALJ accepts proposed order.

scott-s|All documents| Calpine/ TW Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement|Jeff, here are Colleen's comments.  At your convenience, let's meet to  discuss. ---------------------- Forwarded by Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron on 03/21/2000  10:16 AM ---------------------------   Colleen Raker 03/20/2000 07:37 PM To: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Calpine/ TW Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement  Attached is a black-lined version of my redraft of certain provisions of the  3/03/00 draft of the above Agreement.  The purpose of my changes was to (i)  apportion the risk assumed by TW and Calpine based on the economic benefits  realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the  risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced  by TW and the list of services routinely performed.  I noticed that there is  no insurance  coverage  required of either Party.  I expect that Calpine  insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position  to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand,  third party property that is in the care, custody and control of TW while it  performs its work, is not covered by Enron's standard general liability  policies.  Builder's risk  coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the  coverage is expensive.  Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning.   If TW plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money  collected by Customer from TW's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section  should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further  edited to stipulate that limitation.  If TW's limitation of liability is to  be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives  under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the  latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.  Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes.      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

dasovich-j|Notes inbox| Re: CTC definition|Sue, Mona, and Dasovich--  Would one of you be available for about 30 mins or so tomorrow p.m. (Thurs)  to square away this issue (maybe around 3 or 4 or so)?  My recollection of  our original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition  period CTCs as set forth in AB1890, so maybe we just need to broaden or  clarify what we mean by "residual CTCs".  I'll actually be at 101 Cal  starting in the p.m. tomorrow, so this could work out pretty well.   Otherwise, I'll be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back in  SFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar (Dasovich you're speaking at it?)  Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too.

Ed     Roger Yang 10/24/2000 01:19 PM To: Edwin Essandoh/HOU/EES@EES cc: Susan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mona Petrochko  Subject: Re: Contract for Gart Sports    Attached is a version of AB1890.  I refer you to pages 31 through 36 which  discusses Sections 367 through 368.  Residual CTCs may have two connotations.  The first connotation is the type  of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period.  For example, the California  IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates.  From those frozen rates, delivery  and procurement costs are subtracted.  What is left over residually is the  recovery of CTCs.  The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs  that are recovered after the frozen rate period.  Due to these two possible  interpretations, I believe that either the term "residual CTCs" needs to be  defined or a better definition of the "Pre-Rolloff Period" and "Post-Rolloff  Period."  After reading the cites that I referred to above, if you believe the  definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections 367 and  368, then I will be comfortable with the current language.  My concern was  that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section 368 that  would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers, and only benefit and protect  Standard Offer customers.  Pursuant to Section 368, the IOUs implemented cost  recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section 367.  I am  worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a  the Post-Rolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plans  (i.e. SDG&E's rate cap).  You can contact Susan Mara, Jeff Dasovich, or Mona Petrochko in Government  Affairs for better clarification if needed.

It was in a previous  contract which provided for an extension period, but is not applicable here.    Tim:  We could forward corrected page to customer, but I agree that it may  not be necessary as it does not add anything but may unnecessarily alarm  Customer.  Roger:   Can you suggest a definition you'd be comfortable with, which  references the code section  - I have not seen the code, but your point is  valid (although I was under the impression "residual CTC's" is understood in  the industry, and the second issue (as raisesd by Tim previously) would be to  maek sure an amendment to AB 1890 does not extend the Pre-Rolloff Period.   My initial suggestion would be along the lines of:      &Pre-Rolloff Period8 shall mean, with respect to each Facility, the  period of time commencing with the      Effective Date and ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is  authorized to collect CTCs (other than residual CTCs      it remains authorized to collect after said date) in its service  territory under AB1890 (as in effect on the Effective Date), but in      any  event not later than March 2002.

In Section 3(a), there is a  definition for "Post-Rolloff Period" which states, "shall mean, with respect  to each Facility, the period of time commencing with the day after the last  day of the Pre-Rolloff Period.....but not including any extension period  pursuant to Section 3(g)(ii).  The problem is that I cannot find Section  3(g)(i) in the contract.  Further, the definition of "Pre-Rolloff Period" which states, "...ending on  the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs (but  excluding residual CTCs) in its service territory under AB1890," is  ambiguous.  There are two possible solutions.  One possible solution is to  define the term "residual CTCs".  Another solution is to redraft the language  to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section 367 and 368 enacted by  AB1890.  Roger      	Enron Energy Services 	 	From:  Tim Carter                           10/19/2000 02:21 PM 	Phone No: tel:  713-853-5496   fax:  713-646-3284   pgr:  888-620-2350 	    To: Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES cc: Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Re: DASH for Gart Sports    You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period  ends differently than we expect.  The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with  AB1890, as noted in the attatched Gart contract.  We have, however,  instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify that  under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than 3/2002.  I  have not received a version of that contract.      Roger Yang 10/19/2000 04:10 PM To: Tim Carter/HOU/EES@EES cc: Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Re: DASH for Gart Sports    I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book  in California.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if the end of the transition  period ends earlier than priced, then our mark for this deal should increase  because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a  shorter period than expected.  Conversely, if the rate freeze ends later than  how we priced it, then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will  have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we  had priced.  This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profile  of our California portfolio.  My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is  defined.  It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose  ends.  Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of  the transition period, which is a critical date because the delivery risks  hinge on that definition.  I just want to do some preventative maintenance,  such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future.   However, we may proceed signing this contract if necessary.  I would just  like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this  deal.  As a matter of fact, I would not even try to change the contract  language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern.  I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now.

I considered items # 2,3,4,6,  9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need  my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:  1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with  you on the concept.  2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.  3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general  rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the  Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements  with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate  agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the  guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty  takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.  4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.  5. I agree with your point #13.  6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the  concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured  Party is holding  the cash collateral.  7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash  collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated  all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination  amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.  8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events  that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as  in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We  could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on  bankruptcy.  I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but  maybe you and I can make some progress.

The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck, although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.

daren_farmer|Enron news|Important Information About United HealthCare - Please Read!|TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits  You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC)  concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate  their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication  also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network  due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.  It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40%  increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to  you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter  proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.  While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC,  Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation  efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it  is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group  and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.    Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals  within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those  with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake  Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our  affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO  options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between  September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial  Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network  benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other  charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be  pre-certified with UHC.  These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary  Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.  If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's  customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases  the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to  UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained  by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).  Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to  consider your elections for 2001.    United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees  through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that  may impact you or your family.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

V V  left me a  message saying that he would still let us "work on the pricing, structuring  side", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick  and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the  impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on  Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense  if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there.   They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are  putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.        *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

errol_mclaughlin_jr|Announcements|EnTouch Newsletter|    BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS   Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading  The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.    The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.    Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative  ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.  This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.  A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.  The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.     eSource  eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded "Spending Wisely on Private Hubs", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.    Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.    Enron Freight Markets  EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.    IN THE NEWS   We are pleased to announce that Sally Beck has been named Chief Operating Officer for Enron Net Works.  She will join Greg Piper, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Pickering, Chief Technology Officer in the Enron Net Works Office of the Chair.  In her current role as Managing Director for Enron Net Works, Sally heads up Enron's Global Risk Management Operations.

mark_haedicke|Budget|2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM| Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.  The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

The other day, we were talking to a manager at a large telecommunications company who was anxious over the contractual arrangements for an electronic-business relationship her company is developing. Specifically, she was worried about the protection of intellectual property in such an arrangement.  Intellectual property - or IP, as it is known to lawyers - refers to copyrights, patents and trade secrets upon which your company depends for its competitive advantage. In short, it,s anything you don,t want your competitors to get their hands on. It can also include intangibles such as goodwill from current customers.  How is IP put at risk in an application service provider (ASP) relationship? In any ASP arrangement, a customer is forced to disclose intellectual property to one degree or another. The property may be simple business plans or proprietary customer information. In any event, it is information that could do a great deal of harm if it were leaked to competitors or the universe at large. In the case of full-service ASPs (those that provide integration and Web design services), IP can also include the look and feel of the business in e-space.  The problem is trust. An ASP must convince its customers that their information is secure. But how does an ASP even know what information needs to be protected? Customers must retain full rights to their intellectual property and ensure that it is secure from disclosure.  The most effective way for a customer to secure IP rights and obligations is through a contract that clearly states who owns what. Just like a prenuptial agreement, both parties go into the arrangement with rights and property. It is important to get these on paper prior to the business relationship. And this contract is different from a service-level agreement SLA). While the SLA is a performance document, the business relationship contract is one of rights and responsibilities.  This also applies to the look and feel of the business. If an ASP develops a Web presence for a customer that provides a unique advantage to that customer, it is essential that the customer get its IP rights in writing. One peculiarity of the IP world is that unless you specifically say something to the contrary, the creator of the IP is the owner.  The guidance Enterprise Management Associates always gives is: when in doubt, write it down. If it offends the other party, at least you know where the sensibilities are. If it doesn,t, then that tells you something as well. In any case, having an obligation or right expressed on paper establishes a point of reference if things get fuzzy in the day-to-day ASP operation.  As our telco manager friend noted, many things are uncertain in the new e-business world we are creating. She is right. But we will be more confident as we proceed if we remember that the obligations of good business practice have not changed.

shapiro-r|Notes inbox| National Journal's CongressDaily - Thursday, June 7, 2001|National Journal's CongressDaily Issue date:  June 7, 2001 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TRADE Presidential Negotiating Authority A Must, Evans Says Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority, rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill may not move this year and showing flexibility on the controversial Jordan free trade agreement, which is backed by some key Democrats. Presidential trade negotiating authority is "number one on my list of issues [that] I am focusing on right now," Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters. Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the bill could "slip" into next year. Evans and a senior administration official also in on the session insisted that the bill must pass this year. They indicated not only was the trade negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, but passage would help bolster U.S. credibility as it tries to launch a new trade round. Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to the American people and that President Bush would be touting it as well. Evans also said the point of this week's announcement that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports under section 201 of U.S. trade law was to see whether the steel industry needed help, but he noted that if the move made Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority, then all the better. The senior official indicated the administration was considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental provisions with sanctions. The bill is supported by some Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues. Some business officials oppose the deal; others are not taking a position. "I think we are all coming around to the conclusion that ... one size does not fit all," the official said. "There's a lot of debate about whether Jordan's going to provide a way forward. I think it's a model. I don't think it is necessarily the model." But he added, "I think there's a number of different ways to approach the problem, and Jordan's one of them." And he compared Jordan's provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. - by Keith Koffler -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TAXES Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money, but echoed Senate Majority Leader Daschle's comments Wednesday that there would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on the way this year. At a news conference criticizing the $1.35 trillion tax cut that became law today, Gephardt and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that energy-related tax cuts and renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just some of the items Congress may need to address. Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need more money for FY02 appropriations bills, Gephardt said it will be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional spending or tax relief, but added: "We will have offsets. We hope the Republicans will do the same." For now, he could offer no specific ideas on what the offsets would be, but he left the door open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of funds. Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may need to modify the 10-year bill President Bush signed today in order to keep the budget balanced, but played down the notion such revisions could happen as early as this year. Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the real impact of the tax cut is 10 years away, and claimed that [President] "George W. is saying, 'Not on my watch.'" The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas. Sources said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering trying to move a patients' rights bill quickly - even if it meant having the bill go right to the floor. There may have also been discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy- related tax break measure. But Rangel and Ways and Means Health Subcommittee ranking member Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., wrote Thomas today "to express our strong opposition to such an effort, and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena.¦ you know, the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this year on this important topic." Meanwhile, GOP leaders are apparently eyeing a number of other priorities. House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his statement greeting Bush's signature of the tax cut bill. Majority Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way, but he acknowledged it could be modest. - by Stephen Norton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TAXES Bush Signs $1.35 Trillion, 10-Year Tax Cut Measure Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly of elite Republican lawmakers, President Bush today signed into law the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax relief package. The legislation, which largely takes its cue from Bush's signature campaign proposal, was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. Bush praised the role of some of the handful of Democrats on hand - including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia. "Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington," Bush said. Calling this "an era of steady cooperation," Bush predicted, "more achievements are ahead." But few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the new era. Among them were Sens. Max Cleland of Georgia, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps. Ralph Hall of Texas, Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Hastert, Senate Minority Leader Lott, House Majority Leader Armey, Senate Minority Whip Nickles, House Majority Whip DeLay, House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were more typical of those attending the bill-signing ceremony. Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut, which expires in a decade, permanent. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to aggressively move the legislation as an amendment. "The first thing we [have] got to do is make this [tax cut] permanent," Gramm told CongressDaily. "I intend to offer it at least a dozen times." Nickles said Republicans will "be successful in either extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for estate taxes, I think," but he acknowledged, "It's going to be a challenge." Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, to provide tax breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to buy health insurance, and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill. Other tax cut vehicles, he said, could be the "Patients' Bill of Rights" and the tax extenders bill. On managed care reform, Nickles said, "there are some discussions going on, but I wouldn't try to claim any optimism" about a deal. - by Keith Koffler -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  HEALTH Senate Readies For Debate On Patients' Rights Proposal With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill, behind-the-scenes discussions are picking up on what is expected to be the chamber's next order of business - debate on a managed care "Patients' Bill of Rights." HHS Secretary Thompson was on Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose differences have thus far proved unbridgeable. President Bush earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to bring to the floor - sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy. And Bush has endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt. At the same time, Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who helped write the McCain-Edwards- Kennedy bill - but deferred sponsorship while he sought to negotiate with the White House - is continuing his efforts, but signaled he will not wait much longer. After one of his meetings today, Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone. "We hope we're able to reach an agreement," he said, but added that "if the president feels strongly and this bill doesn't reach his principles, he will" veto it. Meanwhile, backers of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords approach said new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the final compromise. According to CBO, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill would, when fully phased in, raise health insurance premiums by an estimated 2.9 percent. That compares to 4.2 percent for the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and 2 percent for the GOP-sponsored bill that passed the Senate in 1999. "Today's CBO report illustrates what we've said all along, that our bill presents a true compromise on the 'Patients' Bill of Rights,'" said Frist. But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate. Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure insist that the president will sign virtually any patients' rights bill Congress manages to pass. That prospect has frightened business and insurance lobbyists, who vehemently oppose provisions that would allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal court. Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again threatening to veto the bill, but also left what one source called "wiggle room" if the Senate makes some, as yet undecided- upon, changes. While opponents of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure fear they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the measure - it appears to have virtually unanimous support among Democrats - save Breaux - as well as at least a handful of Republicans, including Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - opponents are more confident about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax- related health insurance "access" provisions. Some of those, including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts, could be controversial. - by Julie Rovner and April Fulton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  SENATE LEADERSHIP Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement on a new organizational resolution for the Senate, although key senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next week. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he hoped negotiators would be able to complete an agreement today. Sen. Pete Domenici, R- N.M., said Republicans were "purifying" their own proposals to decide how many points to include. Gramm and Domenici are part of a five-member GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle. Daschle said today negotiations were "going well," but declined to give details. The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today. But before any deal is final, Republicans will run any agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference - a requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until mid-week. Republicans have backed down on their requirement that any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential nominations to the floor. Instead, said a GOP aide, negotiators will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement, or a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor. Democrats, meanwhile, have given in to a GOP demand that committees be expanded to reflect a one-seat Democratic advantage, rather than bumping Republicans from panels. Said Commerce Chairman Hollings, "I'm not comfortable with it, but that's what it's going to be." Hollings' panel will grow to 23 members, a size he said will make it hard to hold efficient hearings. "You get through opening statements and, good God, the day is over," he said. - by Geoff Earle -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy, Environment Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised not to use his new chairmanship to "practice the politics of personal attacks and destruction," but said he will investigate the high cost of energy, as well as ask the Bush administration to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards. "The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply in some parts of our country . will be the committee's immediate priority," Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters. Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a June 20 hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable. "From all that I have seen . I think FERC has the authority to act and should have acted already," Lieberman said. A cosponsor of price cap legislation proposed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D- Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., Lieberman said he would not ordinarily favor price controls, but said the lack of competition in the Western energy market warrants them. Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards regulating arsenic, forest roadbuilding and mining waste. "Who did you talk to?" Lieberman asked rhetorically of the administration's rapid rollback of federal policy long in the making. He also said he would "put the breaks on any additional plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards." Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and said they would work together on issues such as reducing government waste and abuse, electronic government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal personnel. As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year's disputed election, Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to use his committee for political retribution. "The difference between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder, but you and I will know it once we see it," he said. When asked specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President Cheney's use of his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory for a political event, Lieberman said definitively no, but compared it to former President Clinton's White House coffees. "It did make me laugh because the event and the explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans said" about the coffees, Lieberman said. - by Mark Wegner -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  ENVIRONMENT Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy, Land Cuts The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously approved an $18.9 billion spending bill today that restores President Bush's proposed cuts in energy research and increases funding for energy conservation and land preservation initiatives, National Journal News Service reported. The measure provides $1.8 billion for energy programs, an increase of $294 million over the administration's request. The panel included $311 million for weatherization and state energy grants, which is an increase of $120 million over last year's level, and includes $940 million for overall energy conservation. Calling the restoration of energy conservation and research funding "crucial," given the nation's electricity woes, subcommittee ranking member Norman Dicks, D-Wash., hailed the panel's "very bipartisan effort" and dedication to conservation spending. "This is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a bipartisan basis," he said. In addition to the increased energy funding, the subcommittee also agreed to provide $1.32 billion for the widely heralded land conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act. Although significantly smaller than CARA, the conservation initiative nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a variety of resource conservation programs. The bill increases funding by $121 million over last year's level and $64 million over the administration's request. The program includes $100 million for state wildlife grants, $45 million for wetlands conservation, $47 million for historic preservation and $60 million in conservation incentives for private landowners. House Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., said the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the Congress made to the compromise program last year when appropriators balked at CARA's 15-year budget commitment to land programs. "That should send a message to the administration that they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it," Obey said. Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday. - by Cyril Zaneski -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  EDUCATION GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict 'Straight A's' Initiative Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category of school funding from a trial program known as "Straight A's" would gut a major component of the president's education bill. The amendment to exempt 21st Century learning centers from the "Straight A's" pilot program would remove almost half of the available money and would discourage states from participating, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said. If the amendment passes, it would "certainly be a blow to the bipartisan coalition that has worked on this bill," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. The "Straight A's" program was taken out of the bill on the House side, so Frist said it was essential the provision stay in the Senate bill when the bills go to conference. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who is sponsoring the amendment, said he still plans to move forward on it. Meanwhile, the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today after Republicans threatened a filibuster, delaying a potentially explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools. The amendment would require states to "achieve comparability of education opportunities" among their schools, and was watered down from earlier, more specific language. "This is not radical, this is common sense," Dodd said during floor debate. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the amendment does not interfere with the president's initiative and encourages states to provide "additional focus and attention on poor and underprivileged children." But Collins said it was an "attempt by the federal government to set national standards." - by April Fulton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  SCHEDULE Senate To Work Through Amendments On Education Next Week The Senate next week will work through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization bill. Majority Leader Daschle said votes are expected Monday, and that he intends to finish the bill by the end of the week. The House will return next week Tuesday for a series of suspension votes after 6 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House is scheduled to take up the Sudan Peace Act and the SEC fees reduction bill, although the latter bill has been postponed several times. No House votes are expected Friday. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Jackson Meets With Lawmakers To Discuss Electoral Reform, Other Issues Rev. Jesse Jackson was on Capitol Hill today meeting with Senate Majority Leader Daschle, and Sens. Christopher Dodd, D- Conn., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to discuss electoral reform and other issues, including judicial nominations. "I'm sure hearings on electoral reform will begin this summer," Jackson said, citing a report to be formally released by the Civil Rights Commission Friday showing that minority voters in Florida were overwhelmingly "disenfranchised." A draft of that proposed report leaked out earlier this week, prompting criticism from Republicans that it was inspired by partisanship. The commission consists of four Democrats, three independents and one Republican. Jackson said, "We must even the playing field for certain voters." Jackson also said he was taking another trip to South Africa to deal with the spread of AIDS in that country. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Stenholm Expects Mark Up Of Emergency Aid To Farmers Next Week House Agriculture ranking member Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, told reporters today he expects the House Agriculture Committee to mark up emergency aid to farmers for this crop year next week. Stenholm also said the amount of aid for this year might be higher than $5.5 billion in the FY02 budget resolution. That money would come from a $79 billion, multi-year pool of funds created to increase agricultural spending. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Daschle PAC To Hold Annual Gala DASHPAC, the leadership PAC of newly minted Senate Majority Leader Daschle, could not have picked a better time - fundraising wise - to schedule its annual Washington bash than this evening. Sources said the DASHPAC gala, which is being held at the 701 restaurant, is expected to pull in over $1 million and possibly break the PAC's previous record. Tickets to tonight's gala are going for $1,000 per individual, $5,000 per PAC or $10,000 for corporate donors: the PAC has a $10,000 limit for contributors. On K Street, lots of heavy lifting has been done by several blue chip lobbyists, including Joel Jankowsky of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; former Daschle staffer Rita Lewis of The Washington Group; and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhand, McPherson & Hand. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Poll Finds Smith, Shaheen Tied A new American Research Group poll shows Sen. Bob Smith, R- N.H., in a statistical tie with Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, but it also shows GOP Rep. John Sununu leading Shaheen by double digits in a trial heat of the 2002 election. The poll, conducted last Friday through Monday of 558 registered voters with a 4.26 point error margin, shows Smith leading Shaheen 42-41 percent, with 17 percent undecided. But Sununu leads Shaheen 51-35 percent, with 14 percent undecided. Sununu has been contemplating a challenge to Smith, who briefly left the Republican Party in 1999 during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, and the Manchester Union-Leader reported today that many state Republicans believe that Sununu has passed the point of no return and will indeed challenge Smith in the GOP primary. However, a recent invitation Sununu sent out for a June 10 fundraiser headlined by former President Bush talks about a House re- election campaign. In the letter, which refers to his 2000 Democratic challenger Martha Fuller Clark, Sununu wrote: "We had a hard fought campaign last year. ... in less than six months time, my opponent spent over $1 million ... already, she has announced her candidacy for 2002. Our campaign next year will be at least as tough, if not tougher." Sununu can transfer the money to a Senate campaign if he decides to enter that race. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TRANSPORTATION Airlines Offer More Voluntary Commitments To Improve Customer Services In an apparent effort to stave off potentially onerous passengers' rights legislation, the airlines announced today they are beefing up their voluntary commitments to improve customer services and also are making those commitments legally enforceable by including them in their customer contracts. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., applauded the industry's latest commitment, saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays. Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay, Young and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction as a factor in air congestion and delay. Fairly narrow passengers' rights legislation pending in the Senate would strengthen the government's hand in holding the airline industry to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a vote in that chamber. Among the airlines' latest commitments, are pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone reservation system, to notify passengers of known delays, cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers "essential needs" during long on-aircraft delays. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  AGRICULTURE Veneman Defends Her Undersecretary Choice Agriculture Secretary Veneman defended a nominee for a top position at her department against allegations he was insensitive to minorities and favored corporate farm interests, the Associated Press reported. Veneman, speaking to reporters after a ceremony honoring former Agriculture Secretary Glickman, called Thomas Dorr, an Iowa farmer picked to be undersecretary for rural development, a "visionary thinker." Dorr's nomination has been criticized by groups representing minority farmers and small- scale farming interests. At Iowa State University in 1999, Dorr observed that an economically prosperous area of his state lacked ethnic and religious diversity. He also has suggested the creation of giant farming operations in which individual farmers would work together. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not scheduled a hearing on Dorr's nomination. Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkin has not taken a position on Dorr. In a recent letter to the committee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said they were shocked that a USDA nominee "would express the belief that ethnic diversity is an impediment to economic growth." -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  THE FINAL WORD "We both have a clear understanding of important issues - like endangered species. After all, he's a Democrat from Kansas and I'm a Republican from California." - Agriculture Secretary Veneman, speaking today at the formal unveiling of the official portrait of former Agriculture Secretary Glickman.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  CongressDaily is published daily, Monday through Friday, by National Journal Group Inc.

fossum-d|'sent mail| Introduction|Lets talk about this--you or I probably have the most to add in a group like  this, but Lee may be the right choice because she is in Houston.  Thanks.  DF ---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 01/04/2000  11:52 AM ---------------------------   Harry Kingerski@EES 01/04/2000 09:25 AM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Introduction  Drew - I talked to Mike Moran this morning and he suggested you for  participation in this corporate working group (see below).  Very glad to have  you.  Other group members are from  various parts of Public Affairs, both  U.S. and International.  Mike also said you may want to have Maria Pavlou  participate, which I leave up to you.  The perspective from the pipeline  group will be a great addition to our effort.  Please see the note below and respond at your earliest convenience.  Thanks  very much.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Harry Kingerski/HOU/EES on 01/04/2000  09:18 AM ---------------------------  Harry Kingerski  12/29/99 11:20 AM Sent by: Judy Pearson To: Rates and Tariffs Working Group cc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Introduction  One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I  have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am  in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called  "Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so  people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been  selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.    The Working Group members are: Ray Alvarez Sergio Assad Roy Boston Mike Grimes Kyran Hanks Rita Hartfield Nancy Hetrick Tom Hoatson Paul Kaufman Valeria Lima Bob Neustaedter  Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related  to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share  resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of  Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and  concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have  a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and  deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy  positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed,  identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring  resources needed by the group.   As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position,  location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble  this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.  Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an  initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are  many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired  time.   As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me  what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster  above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We  will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and  distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that  first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and  the proposed goals.   Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with  you.       *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

germany-c|Discussion threads| CNR - CES producers to Enron|Okay... to ensure we are all on the same page. I've talked to Jill  Linkenauger and Heidi Griffith... and the following will be done.  Jill has forwarded to Heidi the CNR file for CES customers and their  addresses. Jill also forwarded the appropriate form that needs to be sent to  the producers, signed, and return to Enron.  Terry Franklin will be the Enron North America contact on the form for these  CNR producers (Jill estimates about 50 CES producers).   Later this week, Heidi will send the form to the CNR's CES customers. Heidi  will put Terry's phone number and address on the form.  We will need the Appalachian Traders (John Singer, Jim Javins, Jill  Linkenauger) to encourage the producers to sign this paper work and get it  back to Enron ASAP. We want the change over done by April estimates.  Jill said if the change did not happen in time for April estimates, she would  help send out the ascii file one more time. At the end of March, Jill will  end her employment with CES... so we can't depend on her in the future months  for this ascii file.  Thanks again for everyone's help in getting the change over done ASAP.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

kenneth_lay|All documents|Club Intrapreneur|Mr. Lay,  I have found the appropriate contacts.  We are now in process.  Please don't  go to any trouble.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Fred Philipson/Corp/Enron on 10/10/2000  11:25 AM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Fred Philipson                           10/06/2000 09:16 AM 	  To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Club Intrapreneur  Mr. Lay,  I hope you don't mind the unsolicited email. I am interested in founding an  internal organization, or club within Enron.  The club would require  executive support in order to be successful.  I,ve therefore sent you a high  level summary outlining the club,s objectives so that you could pass it along  to the correct executive(s) for further consideration if you think the idea  has merit. I anticipate operating this program on my own time, so the  incremental costs to the company would be minimal. Thank you in advance for  your consideration.  Fred Philipson   Name Club Intrapreneur  Mission of Potential Organization To nurture entrepreneurial concepts consistent with Enron strategies and  abilities, bringing them to the point of a written business plan through the  collective, informal participation of Enron employees.    Value Proposition The club will stimulate, nurture and capitalize on the innovation of  collective individuals within the organization, serving as a catalyst for  developing businesses within Enron.   Problem Statement Many innovative ideas abound among Enron employees, yet they largely go  unshared or if shared, go undeveloped due to the present lack of a forum.    Solution This internal club could foster these ideas, reducing these lost  opportunities.  The club could serve as a repository of information,  referring concept development to receptive mentors that could add insight  into an idea,s development.   Overview of club services £ Quarterly speakers from the business community giving brown bag seminars at  Enron.  These speakers could be entrepreneurship professors from  Rice,  venture capitalists or even entrepreneurs from outside Houston.  According to  the Rice University Executive Education Office, Rice   professors charge  $2,000/day, although many could be encouraged to speak pro bono, given their  relationship with high-level Enron executives.   These speakers can also come  from within Enron,s executive ranks, thereby further sharing knowledge and  showing support for the club. £ Monthly seminar-format meetings between Enron executive sponsors and club  members to review concepts and choose those that should be   nurtured further. £ Weekly, informal lunch meetings with club members discussing strategies and  ideas, assigning action items, creating goals and targets for an idea,s   development. £ Intranet site containing club meeting information, white papers, topics  under discussion, links to relevant sites and an overview of Enron,s  strategic  direction, which would serve as a template showing intrapreneurs  the types of ideas Enron would be most interested in developing.    *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

shapiro-r|All documents| Barton Subcommittee Passes Energy Bill Without Electricity Amendments|Late tonight, the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package  (without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation)  on a bipartisan vote of 29-1.  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs.  Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable  energy projects.  During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern  to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the  full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday  and Wednesday.  The amendments in this category are:  1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the "blackout and price gouging  prevention amendment" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price  mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based  rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be  withholding power from the grid during an emergency.  The cost-of-service  rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the  Western U.S.  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when  it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it  until full committee.  We will continue those efforts before the full  committee vote.  2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote  wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill  rather than full committee on this bill).  3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the  requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places.  He said that  currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC  approved.  4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop  and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a  UN agreement that President George Bush ("41") agreed to in 1992 (reducing  these emissions to 1990 levels).  Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric  restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending  on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full  committee and in the full House.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Employee Fact Sheet: ProBusiness/Intuit W-2 service    Q.  What is the Automated Tax Return (ATR) service? A. Intuit Inc., makers of the popular Quicken TurboTax tax preparation and  filing software, have launched a new Automated Tax Return (ATR) service to  simplify tax preparation for TurboTax users. ATR allows users of TurboTax tax  preparation and filing software to import tax information from multiple  sources such as employers, brokerage houses, and mutual fund companies  directly into the correct TurboTax forms over the Internet.

errol_mclaughlin_jr|All documents|NatSource Deal Valuation|Bob,  I have compiled three Excel files that value Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps  and options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to  be the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book  administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should  correlate with how credit valued these deals.  Each file consists of a  summary worksheet and a detail worksheet for each deal.  Please feel free to  call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.

This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in communities across the US.  We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen. THANKS JACK!!!  On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference "Digital Divide: A Call to Action".  Each of you will receive an complimentary invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch, Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of courses utilized).

david_delainey|Discussion threads|Re: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule|Larry and Joe,   Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get  the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues   and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has  made a world of difference.  Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 05/17/2000  08:18 PM ---------------------------   Gavin Gaul@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/17/2000 03:01 PM To: Mark Dobler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: John Normand/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mike J  Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mitch Robinson/Corp/Enron@Enron, David W Delainey@ECT,  Robert P Virgo@ECT, Bill Fox/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Larry L  Izzo/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Dennis  Alexander/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Subject: Re: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule    Mark,  We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the  removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested  Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed  that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the  unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that  the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit  #2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait  for the unit to cool down.    The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It  showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted  in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would  not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in  parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another  schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step  in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the  duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from  the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that  removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure.   As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade  rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to  everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup  activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.  As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason  #1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the  meeting this morning was June 4-7.

After 6 days of daily conferences on the  subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources  required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I  believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines  available as possible by June 1.  Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing  Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of  producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely,  vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring  issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.  ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete  schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly  and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have  this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's  meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed  in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day  schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the  communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between  Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards  getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this  plan to be circulated today.  Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there  will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections  during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in  writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying  any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.  If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request  it.  We collectively have 14 days to decl
